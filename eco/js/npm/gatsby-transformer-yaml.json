Supports arrays of objects and single objects.\n\nSupported extensions: `.yaml`, `.yml`\n\nBoth `.yaml` and `.yml` are treated in the same way. This document uses both of them interchangeably.\n\n## Install\n\n`npm install gatsby-transformer-yaml`\n\n**Note:** You also need to have `gatsby-source-filesystem` installed and configured so it\npoints to your files.\n\n## How to use\n\nIn your `gatsby-config.js`\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    `gatsby-transformer-yaml`,\n    {\n      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,\n      options: {\n        path: `./src/data/`,\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nWhere the _source folder_ `./src/data/` contains the `.yaml` files.\n\n## Parsing algorithm\n\nYou can choose to structure your data as arrays of objects in individual files\nor as single objects spread across multiple files.\n\nThe _source folder_ can contain either the following:\n\n- **Array of Objects**: Where each file represents a collection. (_you probably want this one_)\n- **Single Object**: Where each _subfolder_ represents a collection; each file represents one \"record\".\n\n### Array of Objects\n\nThe algorithm for YAML arrays is to convert each item in the array into a node.\nThe type of the node is based on the filename.\n\nSo if your project has a `letters.yaml` which looks like:\n\n```yaml\n- character: a\n- character: b\n- character: c\n```\n\nThen the following three nodes would be created.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"character\": \"a\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"character\": \"b\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"character\": \"c\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Single Object\n\nThe algorithm for single YAML objects is to convert the object defined at the\nroot of the file into a node. The type of the node is based on the name of the\nparent directory.\n\nFor example, let's say your project has a data layout like:\n\n```text\ndata/\n    letters/\n        a.yml\n        b.yml\n        c.yml\n```\n\nWhere each of `a.yml`, `b.yml` and `c.yml` look like:\n\n```yaml\ncharacter: a\n```\n\n```yaml\ncharacter: b\n```\n\n```yaml\ncharacter: c\n```\n\nThen the following three nodes would be created.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"character\": \"a\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"character\": \"b\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"character\": \"c\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## How to query\n\nYou can query the nodes using GraphQL, like from the GraphiQL browser: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`.\n\nRegardless of whether you choose to structure your data in arrays of objects or\nsingle objects, you'd be able to query your letters like:\n\n```graphql\n{\n  allLettersYaml {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        character\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhich would return:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  allLettersYaml: {\n    edges: [\n      {\n        node: {\n          character: \"a\",\n        },\n      },\n      {\n        node: {\n          character: \"b\",\n        },\n      },\n      {\n        node: {\n          character: \"c\",\n        },\n      },\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlease do **note** that `allLettersYaml` **will not** show up if you do not have any `.yaml` files.\n\n## Configuration options\n\n**`typeName`** [string|function][optional]\n\nThe default naming convention documented above can be changed with\neither a static string value (e.g. to be able to query all yaml with a\nsimple query):\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    {\n      resolve: `gatsby-transformer-yaml`,\n      options: {\n        typeName: `Yaml`, // a fixed string\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n```graphql\n{\n  allYaml {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        value\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nor a function that receives the following arguments:\n\n- `node`: the graphql node that is being processed, e.g. a File node with\n  yaml content\n- `object`: a single object (either an item from an array or the whole yaml content)\n- `isArray`: boolean, true if `object` is part of an array\n\n```yaml\n- level: info\n  message: hurray\n- level: info\n  message: it works\n- level: warning\n  message: look out\n```\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    {\n      resolve: `gatsby-transformer-yaml`,\n      options: {\n        typeName: ({ node, object, isArray }) => object.level,\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n```graphql\n{\n  allInfo {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        message\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":2651},{"from":"2021-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":10908},{"from":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":54809},{"from":"2021-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":177289},{"from":"2021-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":379917},{"from":"2020-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":758980}],"dependentsCount":298,"starsCount":0},"github":{"homepage":"https://www.gatsbyjs.com","starsCount":51195,"forksCount":9856,"subscribersCount":880,"issues":{"count":31487,"openCount":417,"distribution":{"3600":4955,"10800":2794,"32400":2869,"97200":4590,"291600":4059,"874800":3494,"2624400":2651,"7873200":3050,"23619600":2029,"70858800":956,"212576400":40},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"laurieontech","commitsCount":150},{"username":"nihgwu","commitsCount":30},{"username":"ascorbic","commitsCount":240},{"username":"devrchancay","commitsCount":13},{"username":"ThomasWang","commitsCount":17},{"username":"freiksenet","commitsCount":119},{"username":"caitlinthefirst","commitsCount":16},{"username":"davidbailey00","commitsCount":67},{"username":"resir014","commitsCount":17},{"username":"hashimwarren","commitsCount":51},{"username":"DSchau","commitsCount":354},{"username":"amberleyromo","commitsCount":112},{"username":"Khaledgarbaya","commitsCount":27},{"username":"jbolda","commitsCount":22},{"username":"Simply007","commitsCount":14},{"username":"ooloth","commitsCount":18},{"username":"fabien0102","commitsCount":13},{"username":"polarathene","commitsCount":12},{"username":"arcanis","commitsCount":23},{"username":"tesseralis","commitsCount":158},{"username":"me4502","commitsCount":16},{"username":"renovate[bot]","commitsCount":116},{"username":"daydream05","commitsCount":16},{"username":"smthomas","commitsCount":12},{"username":"Slashgear","commitsCount":17},{"username":"scottyeck","commitsCount":20},{"username":"KyleAMathews","commitsCount":2980},{"username":"LekoArts","commitsCount":379},{"username":"ChangoMan","commitsCount":12},{"username":"0x80","commitsCount":32},{"username":"coreyward","commitsCount":13},{"username":"sasurau4","commitsCount":12},{"username":"TylerBarnes","commitsCount":67},{"username":"greglobinski","commitsCount":21},{"username":"DanielSLew","commitsCount":20},{"username":"erquhart","commitsCount":19},{"username":"jbampton","commitsCount":76},{"username":"oorestisime","commitsCount":26},{"username":"duffn","commitsCount":23},{"username":"fk","commitsCount":217},{"username":"kawamataryo","commitsCount":13},{"username":"jamo","commitsCount":56},{"username":"johno","commitsCount":75},{"username":"Ekwuno","commitsCount":22},{"username":"lannonbr","commitsCount":89},{"username":"herecydev","commitsCount":23},{"username":"blainekasten","commitsCount":95},{"username":"anubhavsrivastava","commitsCount":16},{"username":"cassiebeckley","commitsCount":16},{"username":"webinista","commitsCount":23},{"username":"dandv","commitsCount":21},{"username":"hoobdeebla","commitsCount":23},{"username":"vladar","commitsCount":235},{"username":"meganesu","commitsCount":38},{"username":"jlengstorf","commitsCount":47},{"username":"madalynrose","commitsCount":16},{"username":"docwhat","commitsCount":14},{"username":"Moocar","commitsCount":51},{"username":"benjaminhoffman","commitsCount":14},{"username":"sebastienfi","commitsCount":35},{"username":"mottox2","commitsCount":64},{"username":"mathieudutour","commitsCount":13},{"username":"mgienow","commitsCount":84},{"username":"iamtraction","commitsCount":9},{"username":"ChristopherBiscardi","commitsCount":186},{"username":"ollelauribostrom","commitsCount":13},{"username":"mxstbr","commitsCount":96},{"username":"gillkyle","commitsCount":107},{"username":"dennari","commitsCount":12},{"username":"calcsam","commitsCount":133},{"username":"pvdz","commitsCount":240},{"username":"janosh","commitsCount":22},{"username":"shannonbux","commitsCount":268},{"username":"m-allanson","commitsCount":354},{"username":"kripod","commitsCount":15},{"username":"ehowey","commitsCount":16},{"username":"CanRau","commitsCount":18},{"username":"stefanprobst","commitsCount":138},{"username":"elrumordelaluz","commitsCount":13},{"username":"benstepp","commitsCount":27},{"username":"alexandernanberg","commitsCount":25},{"username":"abhishekjakhar","commitsCount":33},{"username":"jquense","commitsCount":110},{"username":"gesposito","commitsCount":13},{"username":"moonmeister","commitsCount":27},{"username":"muescha","commitsCount":301},{"username":"phacks","commitsCount":13},{"username":"abhiaiyer91","commitsCount":13},{"username":"szimek","commitsCount":12},{"username":"wardpeet","commitsCount":444},{"username":"MichaelDeBoey","commitsCount":24},{"username":"tsriram","commitsCount":29},{"username":"marcysutton","commitsCount":24},{"username":"avigoldman","commitsCoun
