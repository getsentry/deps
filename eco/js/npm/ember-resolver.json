It is a system that helps the app resolve the lookup of JavaScript modules agnostic of what kind of module system is used, which can be AMD, CommonJS or just plain globals. It is used to lookup routes, models, components, templates, or anything that is used in your Ember app.\n\nThis project provides the Ember resolver used by the following projects:\n\n* [ember-cli](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli)\n* [ember-app-kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit)\n* [ember-appkit-rails](https://github.com/DavyJonesLocker/ember-appkit-rails)\n\n## Installation\n\n`ember-resolver` is an ember-cli addon, and should be installed with `ember install`:\n\n```\nember install ember-resolver\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo customize pluralization provide a `pluralizedTypes` object to your extended version of the Resolver in consuming app:\n\n```js\n# app/resolver.js\nimport Resolver from 'ember-resolver';\n\nexport default Resolver.extend({\n  pluralizedTypes: {\n    'sheep': 'sheep',\n    'strategy': 'strategies'\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Upgrading\n\n`ember-resolver` is normally bumped with ember-cli releases. To install a newer\nversion use `yarn` or `npm`. For example:\n\n```\nyarn upgrade ember-resolver\n```\n\n### Migrating from bower\n\nBefore v1.0.1 `ember-resolver` was primarially consumed via bower. To migrate\ninstall the addon version via `yarn` or `npm`. If you're currently using\n`ember-resolver` v0.1.x in your project, you should uninstall it:\n\n```\nbower uninstall ember-resolver --save\n```\n\n_You can continue to use ember-resolver v0.1.x as a bower package, but be\ncareful not to update it to versions greater than v1.0._\n\n## Addon Development\n\n### Installation\n\n* `git clone` this repository\n* `npm install`\n* `bower install`\n\n### Running\n\n* `ember server`\n* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.\n\n### Running Tests\n\n* `ember test`\n* `ember test --server`\n\n### Building\n\n* `ember build`\n\nFor more information on using ember-cli, visit [http://www.ember-cli.com/](http://www.ember-cli.com/).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nAs mentioned above, `ember-resolver` is no longer a bower package.  If you're seeing a message like this:\n\n```\nUnable to find a suitable version for ember-resolver, please choose one:\n    1) ember-resolver#~0.1.20 which resolved to 0.1.21 and is required by ember-resolver#2.0.3\n    2) ember-resolver#~2.0.3 which resolved to 2.0.3 and is required by [APP_NAME]\n```\n\n... you probably need to update your application accordingly.  See [aptible/dashboard.aptible.com#423](https://github.com/aptible/dashboard.aptible.com/pull/423/files) as an example of how to update."},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":5676},{"from":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":142570},{"from":"2021-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":586251},{"from":"2021-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":1767229},{"from":"2021-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":3793529},{"from":"2020-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":7270833}],"dependentsCount":5,"starsCount":0},"github":{"starsCount":88,"forksCount":94,"subscribersCount":16,"issues":{"count":686,"openCount":22,"distribution":{"3600":207,"10800":60,"32400":38,"97200":48,"291600":50,"874800":72,"2624400":79,"7873200":64,"23619600":41,"70858800":15,"212576400":12},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"rwjblue","commitsCount":149},{"username":"williamsbdev","commitsCount":1},{"username":"abhilashlr","commitsCount":1},{"username":"krisselden","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ghempton","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jdjkelly","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mikeumus","commitsCount":2},{"username":"backspace","commitsCount":1},{"username":"trabus","commitsCount":3},{"username":"denisnazarov","commitsCount":3},{"username":"zigomir","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ReadmeCritic","commitsCount":1},{"username":"bekzod","commitsCount":1},{"username":"joshvfleming","commitsCount":1},{"username":"teddyzeenny","commitsCount":6},{"username":"rahulcs","commitsCount":5},{"username":"cibernox","commitsCount":2},{"username":"givanse","commitsCount":1},{"username":"acorncom","commitsCount":1},{"username":"btecu","commitsCount":2},{"username":"bianjp","commitsCount":1},{"username":"buschtoens","commitsCount":9},{"username":"lukemelia","commitsCount":1},{"username":"simonihmig","commitsCount":1},{"username":"dependabot[bot]","commitsCount":36},{"username":"bcardarella","commitsCount":2},{"username":"dependabot-preview[bot]","commitsCount":5},{"username":"daniellawrence","commitsCount":1},{"username":"eccegordo","commitsCount":1},{"username":"chancancode","commitsCount":1},{"username":"xtian","commitsCount":1},{"username":"tim-evans","commitsCount":4},{"username":"ppcano","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jonkirkman","commitsCount":2},{"username":"abuiles","commitsCount":2},{"username":"stefanpenner","commitsCount":45},{"username":"rmachielse","commitsCount":2},{"username":"dfreeman","commitsCount":1},{"username":"rlivsey","commitsCount":2},{"username":"darbyw","commitsCount":1},{"username":"josemarluedke","commitsCount":1},{"username":"kellyselden","commitsCount":1},{"username":"alexspeller","commitsCount":1},{"username":"zeppelin","commitsCount":1},{"username":"joliss","commitsCount":1},{"username":"NullVoxPopuli","commitsCount":4},{"username":"mixonic","commitsCount":29},{"username":"leobugoni","commitsCount":1},{"username":"gmurphey","commitsCount":1},{"username":"tricknotes","commitsCount":3},{"username":"trentmwillis","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mike-north","commitsCount":2},{"username":"greenkeeperio-bot","commitsCount":3},{"username":"iezer","commitsCount":11},{"username":"yamadapc","commitsCount":1},{"username":"chrism","commitsCount":1},{"username":"wagenet","commitsCount":1},{"username":"brendanoh","commitsCount":1},{"username":"toranb","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ef4","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jayphelps","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Turbo87","commitsCount":4},{"username":"snewcomer","commitsCount":1},{"username":"dcyriller","commitsCount":1},{"username":"hjdivad","commitsCount":1}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":3},{"from":"2021-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":11},{"from":"2021-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":24},{"from":"2020-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":54}],"statuses":[{"context":"continuous-integration/travis-ci/push","state":"success"}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":2998,"testsSize":34654,"hasNpmIgnore":true,"hasChangelog":true},"badges":[{"urls":{"original":"https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/ember-resolver.svg?branch=master","service":"https://api.travis-ci.org/ember-cli/ember-resolver.svg?branch=master","shields":"https://img.shields.io/travis/ember-cli/ember-resolver/master.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/travis/ember-cli/ember-resolver/master.json"},"info":{"service":"travis","type":"build","modifiers":{"branch":"master"}}}],"linters":["editorconfig","eslint"]}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.9999999999999999,"tests":0.85,"health":1,"branding":0.15},"popularity":{"communityInterest":263,"downloadsCount":589076.3333333334,"downloadsAcceleration":194.1700722983269,"dependentsCount":5},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":0.11095890410958904,"commitsFrequency":0.8368835616438356,"openIssues":1,"issuesDistribution":
