Let's shorten it by glob-like patterns.<br>\n  Before: `npm run clean && npm run build:css && npm run build:js && npm run build:html`<br>\n  After: `npm-run-all clean build:*`\n- **Cross platform.** We sometimes use `&` to run multiple command in parallel, but `cmd.exe` (`npm run-script` uses it by default) does not support the `&`. Half of Node.js users are using it on Windows, so the use of `&` might block contributions. `npm-run-all --parallel` works well on Windows as well.\n\n## üíø Installation\n\n```bash\n$ npm install npm-run-all --save-dev\n# or\n$ yarn add npm-run-all --dev\n```\n\n- It requires `Node@>=4`.\n\n## üìñ Usage\n\n### CLI Commands\n\nThis `npm-run-all` package provides 3 CLI commands.\n\n- [npm-run-all]\n- [run-s]\n- [run-p]\n\nThe main command is [npm-run-all].\nWe can make complex plans with [npm-run-all] command.\n\nBoth [run-s] and [run-p] are shorthand commands.\n[run-s] is for sequential, [run-p] is for parallel.\nWe can make simple plans with those commands.\n\n#### Yarn Compatibility\n\nIf a script is invoked with Yarn, `npm-run-all` will correctly use Yarn to execute the plan's child scripts.\n\n### Node API\n\nThis `npm-run-all` package provides Node API.\n\n- [Node API]\n\n## üì∞ Changelog\n\n- https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all/releases\n\n## üçª
