If you\nwant to enable source maps for production builds you can configure that in your\n`ember-cli-build.js` too:\n\n```js\n// ember-cli-build.js\n\nvar app = new EmberApp({\n  sourcemaps: {\n    enabled: true,\n    extensions: ['js'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n\nLicense\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nember-cli-uglify is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md)."},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","count":2113},{"from":"2021-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","count":62789},{"from":"2021-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","count":283019},{"from":"2021-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","count":952818},{"from":"2021-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","count":2022550},{"from":"2020-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","count":4679034}],"dependentsCount":8,"starsCount":0},"github":{"starsCount":19,"forksCount":22,"subscribersCount":8,"issues":{"count":286,"openCount":14,"distribution":{"3600":98,"10800":25,"32400":14,"97200":12,"291600":15,"874800":27,"2624400":38,"7873200":40,"23619600":9,"70858800":2,"212576400":6},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"rwjblue","commitsCount":16},{"username":"dcyriller","commitsCount":3},{"username":"jaswilli","commitsCount":1},{"username":"dependabot-preview[bot]","commitsCount":3},{"username":"kategengler","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mikrostew","commitsCount":1},{"username":"theenadayalank","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jrjohnson","commitsCount":1},{"username":"greenkeeperio-bot","commitsCount":1},{"username":"dependabot[bot]","commitsCount":22},{"username":"mike-engel","commitsCount":2},{"username":"stefanpenner","commitsCount":6},{"username":"Turbo87","commitsCount":20},{"username":"jkarsrud","commitsCount":6},{"username":"jelhan","commitsCount":1}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","count":2},{"from":"2021-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","count":13},{"from":"2021-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","count":22},{"from":"2020-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","count":61}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":2391,"testsSize":4057,"hasNpmIgnore":true,"hasChangelog":true},"badges":[{"urls":{"original":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ember-cli-uglify.svg","shields":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ember-cli-uglify.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ember-cli-uglify.json"},"info":{"service":"npm","type":"version","modifiers":{"type":"v"}}},{"urls":{"original":"https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/ember-cli-uglify.svg?branch=master","service":"https://api.travis-ci.org/ember-cli/ember-cli-uglify.svg?branch=master","shields":"https://img.shields.io/travis/ember-cli/ember-cli-uglify/master.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/travis/ember-cli/ember-cli-uglify/master.json"},"info":{"service":"travis","type":"build","modifiers":{"branch":"master"}}},{"urls":{"original":"https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xbx40pk5b4ykawjh/branch/master?svg=true","service":"https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xbx40pk5b4ykawjh/branch/master","shields":"https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/xbx40pk5b4ykawjh/branch/master.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/xbx40pk5b4ykawjh/branch/master.json"},"info":{"service":"appveyor","type":"build"}}],"linters":["editorconfig"],"outdatedDependencies":{"broccoli-uglify-sourcemap":{"required":"^3.1.0","stable":"4.0.0","latest":"4.0.0"}}}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.9999999999999999,"tests":0.6,"health":0.75,"branding":0.44999999999999996},"popularity":{"communityInterest":64,"downloadsCount":317606,"downloadsAcceleration":-1242.046727549467,"dependentsCount":8},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":0.9,"commitsFrequency":0.9,"openIssues":1,"issuesDistribution":0.9}},"score":{"final":0.6882041198833947,"detail":{"quality":0.9343658047928721,"popularity":0.1655179785382973,"maintenance":0.999894531306083}}}
