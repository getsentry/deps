of the\n  limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps, so you can create high-quality,\n  dynamic web apps, from blogs to e-commerce sites to user dashboards.\n\n- **Use a Modern Stack for Every Site.** No matter where the data comes from, Gatsby sites are\n  built using React and GraphQL. Build a uniform workflow for you and your team, regardless of\n  whether the data is coming from the same backend.\n\n- **Load Data From Anywhere.** Gatsby pulls in data from any data source, whether it’s Markdown\n  files, a headless CMS like Contentful or WordPress, or a REST or GraphQL API. Use source plugins\n  to load your data, then develop using Gatsby’s uniform GraphQL interface.\n\n- **Performance Is Baked In.** Ace your performance audits by default. Gatsby automates code\n  splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading and prefetching resources,\n  and more to ensure your site is fast — no manual tuning required.\n\n- **Host at Scale for Pennies.** Gatsby sites don’t require servers, so you can host your entire\n  site on a CDN for a fraction of the cost of a server-rendered site. Many Gatsby sites can be\n  hosted entirely free on services like GitHub Pages and Netlify.\n\n[**Learn how to use Gatsby for your next project.**](https://gatsbyjs.org/docs/)\n\n## What’s In This Document\n\n- [Get Up and Running in 5 Minutes](#-get-up-and-running-in-5-minutes)\n- [Learning Gatsby](#-learning-gatsby)\n- [Migration Guides](#-migration-guides)\n- [How to Contribute](#-how-to-contribute)\n- [Thanks to Our Contributors and Sponsors](#-thanks-to-our-contributors-and-sponsors)\n\n## 🚀 Get Up and Running in 5 Minutes\n\nYou can get a new Gatsby site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these three steps:\n\n1.  **Create a Gatsby site from a Gatsby starter.**\n\n    Get your Gatsby blog set up in a single command:\n\n    ```shell\n    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter\n    gatsby new my-blazing-fast-site\n    ```\n\n2.  **Start the site in `develop` mode.**\n\n    Next, move into your new site’s directory and start it up:\n\n    ```shell\n    cd my-blazing-fast-site/\n    npm run develop\n    ```\n\n3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**\n\n    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the `my-blazing-fast-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!\n\nAt this point, you’ve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).\n\n## 🎓 Learning Gatsby\n\nFull documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://gatsbyjs.org/).\n\n- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.\n\n- **To dive straight into code samples head [to our documentation](https://gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the “Guides”, API reference, and “Advanced Tutorials” sections in the sidebar.\n\nWe welcome suggestions for improving our docs. See the [“how to contribute”](https://gatsbyjs.org/contributing/how-to-contribute/) documentation for more details.\n\n**Start Learning Gatsby: [Follow the Tutorial](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) · [Read the Docs](https://gatsbyjs.org/docs/)**\n\n## 💼 Migration Guides\n\nAlready have a Gatsby site? These handy guides will help you add the improvements of Gatsby v2 to your site without starting from scratch!\n\n- [Migrate a Gatsby site from v1 to v2](https://gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/)\n- Still on v0? Start here: [Migrate a Gatsby site from v0 to v1](https://gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v0-to-v1/)\n\n## 🤝 How to Contribute\n\nWhether you're helping us fix bugs, improve the docs, or spread the word, we'd love to have you as part of the Gatsby community! :muscle::purple_heart:\n\nCheck out our [contributor onboarding docs](https://gatsbyjs.org/contributing/how-to-contribute/) for ideas on contributing and setup steps for getting our repos up and running on your local machine.\n\n[**Read the Contributing Guide**](https://gatsbyjs.org/contributing/how-to-contribute/)\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nGatsby is dedicated to building a welcoming, diverse, safe community. We expect everyone participating in the Gatsby community to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://gatsbyjs.org/contributing/code-of-conduct/). Please read it. Please follow it. In the Gatsby community, we work hard to build each other up and create amazing things together. 💪💜\n\n[**Read the Code of Conduct**](https://gatsbyjs.org/contributing/code-of-conduct/)\n\n### A note on how this repository is organized\n\nThis repository is a [monorepo](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/monorepos/) managed using [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). This means there are [multiple packages](/packages) managed in this codebase, even though we publish them to NPM as separate packages.\n\n### Contributing to Gatsby v1\n\nWe are currently only accepting bug fixes for Gatsby v1. No new features will be accepted.\n\n## 💜 Thanks to Our Contributors and Sponsors\n\nThanks to our many contributors and sponsors as well as the companies sponsoring\nour testing and hosting
