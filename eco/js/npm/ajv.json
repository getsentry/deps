50% faster than the second place\n- [jsck benchmark](https://github.com/pandastrike/jsck#benchmarks) - 20-190% faster\n- [z-schema benchmark](https://rawgit.com/zaggino/z-schema/master/benchmark/results.html)\n- [themis benchmark](https://cdn.rawgit.com/playlyfe/themis/master/benchmark/results.html)\n\nPerformance of different validators by [json-schema-benchmark](https://github.com/ebdrup/json-schema-benchmark):\n\n[![performance](https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chxt=x,y&cht=bhs&chco=76A4FB&chls=2.0&chbh=62,4,1&chs=600x416&chxl=-1:|ajv|@exodus&#x2F;schemasafe|is-my-json-valid|djv|@cfworker&#x2F;json-schema|jsonschema&chd=t:100,69.2,51.5,13.1,5.1,1.2)](https://github.com/ebdrup/json-schema-benchmark/blob/master/README.md#performance)\n\n## Features\n\n- Ajv implements JSON Schema [draft-06/07/2019-09/2020-12](http://json-schema.org/) standards (draft-04 is supported in v6):\n  - all validation keywords (see [JSON Schema validation keywords](https://ajv.js.org/json-schema.html))\n  - [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md) extensions:\n    - NEW: keyword [discriminator](https://ajv.js.org/json-schema.html#discriminator).\n    - keyword [nullable](https://ajv.js.org/json-schema.html#nullable).\n  - full support of remote references (remote schemas have to be added with `addSchema` or compiled to be available)\n  - support of recursive references between schemas\n  - correct string lengths for strings with unicode pairs\n  - JSON Schema [formats](https://ajv.js.org/guide/formats.html) (with [ajv-formats](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-formats) plugin).\n  -
