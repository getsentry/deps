Unfortunately NPM does not allow to list optional peer dependencies.\n\n```yaml\nextends:\n  - eslint:recommended\n  - plugin:import/recommended\n  - plugin:import/typescript # this line does the trick\n```\n\n[`@typescript-eslint/parser`]: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/HEAD/packages/parser\n\n# Resolvers\n\nWith the advent of module bundlers and the current state of modules and module\nsyntax specs, it's not always obvious where `import x from 'module'` should look\nto find the file behind `module`.\n\nUp through v0.10ish, this plugin has directly used substack's [`resolve`] plugin,\nwhich implements Node's import behavior. This works pretty well in most cases.\n\nHowever, webpack allows a number of things in import module source strings that\nNode does not, such as loaders (`import 'file!./whatever'`) and a number of\naliasing schemes, such as [`externals`]: mapping a module id to a global name at\nruntime (allowing some modules to be included more traditionally via script tags).\n\nIn the interest of supporting both of these, v0.11 introduces resolvers.\n\nCurrently [Node] and [webpack] resolution have been implemented, but the\nresolvers are just npm packages, so [third party packages are supported](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/wiki/Resolvers) (and encouraged!).\n\nYou can reference resolvers in several ways (in order of precedence):\n\n- as a conventional `eslint-import-resolver` name, like `eslint-import-resolver-foo`:\n\n```yaml\n# .eslintrc.yml\nsettings:\n  # uses 'eslint-import-resolver-foo':\n  import/resolver: foo\n```\n```js\n// .eslintrc.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  settings: {\n    'import/resolver': {\n      foo: { someConfig: value }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- with a full npm module name, like `my-awesome-npm-module`:\n\n```yaml\n# .eslintrc.yml\nsettings:\n  import/resolver: 'my-awesome-npm-module'\n```\n```js\n// .eslintrc.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  settings: {\n    'import/resolver': {\n      'my-awesome-npm-module': { someConfig: value }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- with a filesystem path to resolver, defined in this example as a `computed property` name:\n\n```js\n// .eslintrc.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  settings: {\n    'import/resolver': {\n      [path.resolve('../../../my-resolver')]: { someConfig: value }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRelative paths will be resolved relative to the source's nearest `package.json` or\nthe process's current working directory if no `package.json` is found.\n\n\n\nIf you are interesting in writing a resolver, see the [spec](./resolvers/README.md) for more details.\n\n[`resolve`]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve\n[`externals`]: http://webpack.github.io/docs/library-and-externals.html\n\n[Node]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-node\n[webpack]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-webpack\n\n# Settings\n\nYou may set the following settings in your `.eslintrc`:\n\n#### `import/extensions`\n\nA list of file extensions that will be parsed as modules and inspected for\n`export`s.\n\nThis defaults to `['.js']`, unless you are using the `react` shared config,\nin which case it is specified as `['.js', '.jsx']`.\n\n```js\n\"settings\": {\n  \"import/extensions\": [\n    \".js\",\n    \".jsx\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIf you require more granular extension definitions, you can use:\n\n```js\n\"settings\": {\n  \"import/resolver\": {\n    \"node\": {\n      \"extensions\": [\n        \".js\",\n        \".jsx\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that this is different from (and likely a subset of) any `import/resolver`\nextensions settings, which may include `.json`, `.coffee`, etc. which will still\nfactor into the `no-unresolved` rule.\n\nAlso, the following `import/ignore` patterns will overrule this list.\n\n#### `import/ignore`\n\nA list of regex strings that, if matched by a path, will\nnot report the matching module if no `export`s are found.\nIn practice, this means rules other than [`no-unresolved`](./docs/rules/no-unresolved.md#ignore) will not report on any\n`import`s with (absolute filesystem) paths matching this pattern.\n\n`no-unresolved` has its own [`ignore`](./docs/rules/no-unresolved.md#ignore) setting.\n\n```yaml\nsettings:\n  import/ignore:\n    - \\.coffee$          # fraught with parse errors\n    - \\.(scss|less|css)$ # can't parse unprocessed CSS modules, either\n```\n\n#### `import/core-modules`\n\nAn array of additional modules to consider as \"core\" modules--modules that should\nbe considered resolved but have no path on the filesystem. Your resolver may\nalready define some of these (for example, the Node resolver knows about `fs` and\n`path`), so you need not redefine those.\n\nFor example, Electron exposes an `electron` module:\n\n```js\nimport 'electron'  // without extra config, will be flagged as unresolved!\n```\n\nthat would otherwise be unresolved. To avoid this, you may provide `electron` as a\ncore module:\n\n```yaml\n# .eslintrc.yml\nsettings:\n  import/core-modules: [ electron ]\n```\n\nIn Electron's specific case, there is a shared config named `electron`\nthat specifies this for you.\n\nContribution of more such shared configs for other platforms are welcome!\n\n#### `import/external-module-folders`\n\nAn array of folders. Resolved modules only from those folders will be considered as \"external\". By default - `[\"node_modules\"]`. Makes sense if you have configured your path or webpack to handle your internal paths differently and want to consider modules from some folders, for example `bower_components` or `jspm_modules`, as \"external\".\n\nThis option is also useful in a monorepo setup: list here all directories that contain monorepo's packages and they will be treated as external ones no matter which resolver is used.\n\nIf you are using `yarn` PnP as your package manager, add the `.yarn` folder and all your installed dependencies will be considered as `external`, instead of `internal`.\n\nEach item in this array is either a folder's name, its subpath, or its absolute prefix path:\n\n- `jspm_modules` will match any file or folder named `jspm_modules` or which has a direct or non-direct parent named `jspm_modules`, e.g. `/home/me/project/jspm_modules` or `/home/me/project/jspm_modules/some-pkg/index.js`.\n\n- `packages/core` will match any path that contains these two segments, for example `/home/me/project/packages/core/src/utils.js`.\n\n- `/home/me/project/packages` will only match files and directories inside this directory, and the directory itself.\n\nPlease note that incomplete names are not allowed here so `components` won't match `bower_components` and `packages/ui` won't match `packages/ui-utils` (but will match `packages/ui/utils`).\n\n#### `import/parsers`\n\nA map from parsers to file extension arrays. If a file extension is matched, the\ndependency parser will require and use the map key as the parser instead of the\nconfigured ESLint parser. This is useful if you're inter-op-ing with TypeScript\ndirectly using webpack, for example:\n\n```yaml\n# .eslintrc.yml\nsettings:\n  import/parsers:\n    @typescript-eslint/parser: [ .ts, .tsx ]\n```\n\nIn this case, [`@typescript-eslint/parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/parser)\nmust be installed and require-able from the running `eslint` module's location\n(i.e., install it as a peer of ESLint).\n\nThis is currently only tested with `@typescript-eslint/parser` (and its predecessor,\n`typescript-eslint-parser`) but should theoretically work with any moderately\nESTree-compliant parser.\n\nIt's difficult to say how well various plugin features will be supported, too,\ndepending on how far down the rabbit hole goes. Submit an issue if you find strange\nbehavior beyond here, but steel your heart against the likely outcome of closing\nwith `wontfix`.\n\n\n#### `import/resolver`\n\nSee [resolvers](#resolvers).\n\n#### `import/cache`\n\nSettings for cache behavior. Memoization is used at various levels to avoid the copious amount of `fs.statSync`/module parse calls required to correctly report errors.\n\nFor normal `eslint` console runs, the cache lifetime is irrelevant, as we can strongly assume that files should not be changing during the lifetime of the linter process (and thus, the cache in memory)\n\nFor long-lasting processes, like [`eslint_d`] or [`eslint-loader`], however, it's important that there be some notion of staleness.\n\nIf you never use [`eslint_d`] or [`eslint-loader`], you may set the cache lifetime to `Infinity` and everything should be fine:\n\n```yaml\n# .eslintrc.yml\nsettings:\n  import/cache:\n    lifetime: ∞  # or Infinity\n```\n\nOtherwise, set some integer, and cache entries will be evicted after that many seconds have elapsed:\n\n```yaml\n# .eslintrc.yml\nsettings:\n  import/cache:\n    lifetime: 5  # 30 is the default\n```\n\n[`eslint_d`]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint_d\n[`eslint-loader`]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-loader\n\n#### `import/internal-regex`\n\nA regex for packages should be treated as internal. Useful when you are utilizing a monorepo setup or developing a set of packages that depend on each other.\n\nBy default, any package referenced from [`import/external-module-folders`](#importexternal-module-folders) will be considered as \"external\", including packages in a monorepo like yarn workspace or lerna environment. If you want to mark these packages as \"internal\" this will be useful.\n\nFor example, if your packages in a monorepo are all in `@scope`, you can configure `import/internal-regex` like this\n\n```yaml\n# .eslintrc.yml\nsettings:\n  import/internal-regex: ^@scope/\n```\n\n\n## SublimeLinter-eslint\n\nSublimeLinter-eslint introduced a change to support `.eslintignore` files\nwhich altered the way file paths are passed to ESLint when linting during editing.\nThis change sends a relative path instead of the absolute path to the file (as ESLint\nnormally provides), which can make it impossible for this plugin to resolve dependencies\non the filesystem.\n\nThis workaround should no longer be necessary with the release of ESLint 2.0, when\n`.eslintignore` will be updated to work more like a `.gitignore`, which should\nsupport proper ignoring of absolute paths via `--stdin-filename`.\n\nIn the meantime, see [roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint#58](https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint/issues/58)\nfor more details and discussion, but essentially, you may find you need to add the following\n`SublimeLinter` config to your Sublime project file:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"folders\":\n    [\n        {\n            \"path\": \"code\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"SublimeLinter\":\n    {\n        \"linters\":\n        {\n            \"eslint\":\n            {\n                \"chdir\": \"${project}/code\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that `${project}/code` matches the `code` provided at `folders[0].path`.\n\nThe purpose of the `chdir` setting, in this case, is to set the working directory\nfrom which ESLint is executed to be the same as the directory on which SublimeLinter-eslint\nbases the relative path it provides.\n\nSee the SublimeLinter docs on [`chdir`](http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/latest/linter_settings.html#chdir)\nfor more information, in case this does not work with your project.\n\nIf you are not using `.eslintignore`, or don't have a Sublime project file, you can also\ndo the following via a `.sublimelinterrc` file in some ancestor directory of your\ncode:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"linters\": {\n    \"eslint\": {\n      \"args\": [\"--stdin-filename\", \"@\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI also found that I needed to set `rc_search_limit` to `null`, which removes the file\nhierarchy search limit when looking up the directory tree for `.sublimelinterrc`:\n\nIn Package Settings / SublimeLinter / User Settings:\n```json\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"rc_search_limit\": null\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI believe this defaults to `3`, so you may not need to alter it depending on your\nproject folder max depth.\n\n[codecov-image]:
