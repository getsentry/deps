Works from both app code and test code.\n\n## Dynamic Import\n\nIn addition to static top-level `import` statements, you can use dynamic `import()` to lazily load your dependencies. This can be great for reducing your initial bundle size.\n\nDynamic import is currently a Stage 3 ECMA feature, so to use it there are a few extra setup steps:\n\n1.  `npm install --save-dev babel-eslint`\n2.  In your `.eslintrc.js` file, add\n\n        parser: 'babel-eslint'\n\n3.  In your `ember-cli-build.js` file, enable the babel plugin provided by ember-auto-import:\n\n```js\nlet app = new EmberApp(defaults, {\n  babel: {\n    plugins: [require.resolve('ember-auto-import/babel-plugin')],\n  },\n});\n```\n\nOnce you're setup, you can use dynamic `import()` and it will result in loading that particular dependency (and all its recursive dependencies) via a separate Javascript file at runtime. Here's an example of using dynamic import from within a `Route`, so that the extra library needed for the route is loaded at the same time the data is loaded:\n\n```js\nexport default Route.extend({\n  model({ id }) {\n    return Promise.all([\n      fetch(`/data-for-chart/${id}`).then(response => response.json()),\n      import('highcharts').then(module => module.default),\n    ]).then(([dataPoints, highcharts]) => {\n      return { dataPoints, highcharts };\n    });\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIf you're using custom deployment code, make sure it will include all the Javascript files in `dist/assets`, not just the default `app.js` and `vendor.js`.\n\n## Customizing Build Behavior\n\nWhile most NPM packages authored in CommonJS or ES Modules will Just Work, for others you may need some give ember-auto-import a hint about what to do.\n\nYou can set options like this in your ember-cli-build.js:\n\n```js\n// In your ember-cli-build.js file\nlet app = new EmberApp(defaults, {\n  autoImport: {\n    alias: {\n      // when the app tries to import from \"plotly.js\", use\n      // the real package \"plotly.js-basic-dist\" instead.\n      'plotly.js': 'plotly.js-basic-dist',\n\n      // you can also use aliases to pick a different entrypoint\n      // within the same package. This can come up when the default\n      // entrypoint only works in Node, but there is also a browser\n      // build available (and the author didn't provide a \"browser\"\n      // field in package.json that would let us detect it\n      // automatically).\n      handlebars: 'handlebars/dist/handlebars',\n\n      // We do a prefix match by default, so the above would also\n      // convert \"handlebars/foo\" to \"handlebars/dist/handlesbars/foo\".\n      // If instad you want an exact match only, you can use a trailing \"$\".\n      // For example, this will rewrite \"some-package/alpha\" to \"customized\"\n      // but leave \"some-package/beta\" alone.\n      'some-package/alpha$': 'customized',\n    },\n    exclude: ['some-package'],\n    skipBabel: [\n      {\n        // when an already-babel-transpiled package like \"mapbox-gl\" is\n        // not skipped, it can produce errors in the production mode\n        // due to double transpilation\n        package: 'mapbox-gl',\n        semverRange: '*',\n      },\n    ],\n    watchDependencies: [\n      // trigger rebuilds if \"some-lib\" changes during development\n      'some-lib',\n      // trigger rebuilds if \"some-lib\"'s inner dependency \"other-lib\" changes\n      ['some-lib', 'other-lib'],\n    ],\n    webpack: {\n      // extra webpack configuration goes here\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nSupported Options\n\n- `alias`: _object_, Map from imported names to substitute names that will be imported instead. This is a prefix match by default. To opt out of prefix-matching and only match exactly, add a `$` suffix to the pattern.\n- `exclude`: _list of strings, defaults to []_. Packages in this list will be ignored by ember-auto-import. Can be helpful if the package is already included another way (like a shim from some other Ember addon).\n- `forbidEval`: _boolean_, defaults to false. We use `eval` in development by default (because that is the fastest way to provide sourcemaps). If you need to comply with a strict Content Security Policy (CSP), you can set `forbidEval: true`. You will still get sourcemaps, they will just use a slower implementation.\n- `insertScriptsAt`: _string_, defaults to undefined. Optionally allows you to take manual control over where ember-auto-import's generated `<script>` tags will be inserted into your HTML and what attributes they will have. See \"Customizing HTML Insertion\" below.\n- `insertStylesAt`: _string_, defaults to undefined. Optionally allows you to take manual control over where ember-auto-import's generated `<link rel=\"stylesheet\">` tags (if any) will be inserted into your HTML and what attributes they will have. See \"Customizing HTML Insertion\" below.\n- `publicAssetURL`: the public URL to your `/assets` directory on the web. Many apps won't need to set this because we try to detect it automatically, but you will need to set this explicitly if you're deploying your assets to a different origin than your app (for example, on a CDN) or if you are using `<script defer>` (which causes scripts to be unable to guess what origin they loaded from).\n- `skipBabel`: _list of objects, defaults to []_. The specified packages will be skipped from babel transpilation.\n- `watchDependencies`: _list of strings or string arrays, defaults to []_. Tells ember-auto-import that you'd like to trigger a rebuild if one of these auto-imported dependencies changes. Pass a package name that refers to one of your own dependencies, or pass an array of package names to address a deeper dependency.\n- `webpack`: _object_, An object that will get merged into the configuration we pass to webpack. This lets you work around quirks in underlying libraries and otherwise customize the way Webpack will assemble your dependencies.\n\n## Usage from Addons\n\nUsing ember-auto-import inside an addon is almost exactly the same as inside an app.\n\n### Installing ember-auto-import in an addon\n\nTo add ember-auto-import to your addon:\n\n- add ember-auto-import to your `dependencies`, not your `devDependencies`, so it will be present when your addon is used by apps\n- add webpack to your `devDependencies` (to support your test suite) but not your `dependencies` (the app's version will be used)\n- document for your users that their app must depend on ember-auto-import >= 2 in order to use your addon\n- configure ember-auto-import (if needed) in your `index.js` file (not your `ember-cli-build.js` file), like this:\n\n  ```js\n  // In your addon's index.js file\n  module.exports = {\n    name: 'sample-addon',\n    options: {\n      autoImport: {\n        exclude: ['some-package'],\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n- if your addon uses [Dynamic Import](#dynamic-import), it is [required](https://github.com/babel/ember-cli-babel#options) that you\n  register the babel plugin in your `index.js` instead of `ember-cli-build.js`:\n  ```js\n  // index.js\n  module.exports = {\n    options: {\n      babel: {\n        plugins: [require.resolve('ember-auto-import/babel-plugin')],\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n### Caveats in addons\n\n- ember-auto-import will refuse to import `devDependencies` of your addon into addon code (because that would fail in a consuming application). You _can_ import `devDependencies` into your test suite & dummy app.\n- ember-auto-import will not detect import statements inside your `app` folder. This is because the files inside `app` are conceptually not part of your addon's own package namespace at all, so they don't get access to your addon's dependencies. Do all your auto-importing from the `addon` folder, and reexport in `app` as needed.\n- while addons are allowed to pass the `autoImport.webpack` option to add things to the webpack config, this makes them less likely to be broadly compatible with apps using different webpack versions. If you need to rely on a specific webpack feature, you should document which versions of webpack you support.\n\n## Customizing HTML Insertion\n\nember-auto-import uses webpack to generate one or more chunk files containing all your auto-imported dependencies, and then ember-auto-import inserts `<script>` tags to your HTML to make sure those chunks are included into your app (and tests, as appropriate). By default, the \"app\" webpack chunk(s) will be inserted after Ember's traditional \"vendor.js\" and the \"tests\" webpack chunk(s) will be inserted after \"test-support.js\".\n\nIf you need more control over the HTML insertion, you can use the `insertScriptsAt` option (or the `insertStylesAt` option, which is exactly analogous but for standalone CSS instead of JS). To customize HTML insertion:\n\n1. Set `insertScriptsAt` to a custom element name. You get to pick the name so that it can't collide with any existing custom elements in your site, but a good default choice is \"auto-import-script\":\n\n   ```js\n   let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {\n     autoImport: {\n       insertScriptsAt: 'auto-import-script',\n     },\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. In your `index.html` and `tests/index.html`, use the custom element to designate exactly where you want the \"app\" and \"tests\" entrypoints to be inserted:\n\n   ```diff\n    <!-- in index.html -->\n    <body>\n      {{content-for \"body\"}}\n      <script src=\"{{rootURL}}assets/vendor.js\"></script>\n   +   <auto-import-script entrypoint=\"app\"></auto-import-script>\n      <script src=\"{{rootURL}}assets/your-app.js\"></script>\n      {{content-for \"body-footer\"}}\n    </body>\n   ```\n\n   ```diff\n    <!-- in tests/index.html -->\n    <body>\n      {{content-for \"body\"}}\n      {{content-for \"test-body\"}}\n\n      <div id=\"qunit\"></div>\n      <div id=\"qunit-fixture\">\n        <div id=\"ember-testing-container\">\n          <div id=\"ember-testing\"></div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <script src=\"/testem.js\" integrity=\"\"></script>\n      <script src=\"{{rootURL}}assets/vendor.js\"></script>\n   +   <auto-import-script entrypoint=\"app\"></auto-import-script>\n      <script src=\"{{rootURL}}assets/test-support.js\"></script>\n   +   <auto-import-script entrypoint=\"tests\"></auto-import-script>\n      <script src=\"{{rootURL}}assets/your-app.js\"></script>\n      <script src=\"{{rootURL}}assets/tests.js\"></script>\n\n      {{content-for \"body-footer\"}}\n      {{content-for \"test-body-footer\"}}\n    </body>\n   ```\n\n3. Any attributes other than `entrypoint` will be copied onto the resulting `<script>` tags inserted by ember-auto-import. For example, if you want `<script defer></script>` you can say:\n\n   ```html\n   <auto-import-script defer entrypoint=\"app\"> </auto-import-script>\n   ```\n\n   And this will result in output like:\n\n   ```html\n   <script defer src=\"/assets/chunk-12341234.js\"></script>\n   ```\n\nOnce you enable `insertScriptsAt` you _must_ designate places for the \"app\" and \"tests\" entrypoints if you want ember-auto-import to work correctly. You may also optionally designate additional entrypoints and manually add them to the webpack config. For example, you might want to build a polyfills bundle that needs to run before `vendor.js` on pre-ES-module browsers:\n\n```js\n// ember-cli-build.js\nlet app = new EmberApp(defaults, {\n  autoImport: {\n    insertScriptsAt: 'auto-import-script',\n    webpack: {\n      entry: {\n        polyfills: './lib/polyfills.js',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n// lib/polyfills.js\nimport 'core-js/stable';\nimport 'intl';\n```\n\n```html\n<!-- index.html -->\n<auto-import-script nomodule entrypoint=\"polyfills\"></auto-import-script>\n<script src=\"{{rootURL}}assets/vendor.js\"></script>\n<auto-import-script entrypoint=\"app\"></auto-import-script>\n<script src=\"{{rootURL}}assets/your-app.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n### `global is undefined` or `can't find module \"path\"` or `can't find module \"fs\"`\n\nYou're trying to use a library that is written to work in NodeJS and not in the browser. You can choose to polyfill the Node feature you need by passing settings to webpack. For example:\n\n```\nlet app = new EmberApp(defaults, {\n  autoImport: {\n    webpack: {\n      node: {\n        global: true,\n        fs: 'empty'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nSee [webpack's docs on Node polyfills](https://v4.webpack.js.org/configuration/node/).\n\n### I use Content Security Policy (CSP) and it breaks ember-auto-import.\n\nSee `forbidEval` above.\n\n### I'm trying to load a jQuery plugin, but it doesn't attach itself to the copy of jQuery that's already in my Ember app.\n\nEmber apps typically get jQuery from the `ember-source` or `@ember/jquery` packages. Neither of these is the real `jquery` NPM package, so ember-auto-import cannot \"see\" it statically at build time. You will need to give webpack a hint to treat jQuery as external:\n\n```js\n// In your ember-cli-build.js file\nlet app = new EmberApp(defaults, {\n  autoImport: {\n    webpack: {\n      externals: { jquery: 'jQuery' },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nAlso, some jQuery plugins like masonry and flickity have [required manual steps to connect them to jQuery](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/issues/59#issuecomment-405391414).\n\n### I upgraded my `ember-auto-import` version and now things don't import. What changed?\n\nAs of version `1.4.0`, by default, `ember-auto-import` does not include webpack's automatic polyfills for certain Node packages.\nSome signs that your app was depending on these polyfills by accident are things like \"global is not defined,\" \"can't resolve path,\" or \"default is not a function.\"\nYou can opt-in to [Webpack's polyfills](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/node/), or install your own.\nSee [this issue](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/issues/224#issuecomment-503400386) for an example.\n\n### I get `Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined` [251](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/issues/251) with an already babel transpiled addon, e.g: `mapbox-gl`\n\nWe should skip that specific addon from the ember-auto-import's babel transpilation as:\n\n```js\n// In your app's ember-cli-build.js file or check the `Usage from Addons` section for relevant usage of the following in addons\nlet app = new EmberApp(defaults, {\n  autoImport: {\n    skipBabel: [\n      {\n        package: 'mapbox-gl',\n        semverRange: '*',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Debugging Tips\n\nSet the environment variable `DEBUG=\"ember-auto-import:*\"` to see debug logging during the build.\n\nTo see Webpack's console output, set the environment variable `AUTO_IMPORT_VERBOSE=true`.\n\n## Credit / History\n\nTakes inspiration and some code from ember-browserify and ember-cli-cjs-transform. This package is basically what you get when you combine the ideas from those two addons.\n\n## Contributing\n\n[See CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md)."},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":122104},{"from":"2021-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":715967},{"from":"2021-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":2091601},{"from":"2021-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":4289528},{"from":"2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":7877419}],"dependentsCount":361,"starsCount":0},"github":{"starsCount":348,"forksCount":71,"subscribersCount":16,"issues":{"count":442,"openCount":91,"distribution":{"3600":88,"10800":21,"32400":30,"97200":39,"291600":30,"874800":42,"2624400":45,"7873200":31,"23619600":34,"70858800":44,"212576400":38},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"houfeng0923","commitsCount":2},{"username":"kiwi-josh","commitsCount":1},{"username":"buschtoens","commitsCount":16},{"username":"gabrielcsapo","commitsCount":7},{"username":"ember-tomster","commitsCount":1},{"username":"deanmarano","commitsCount":1},{"username":"f1sherman","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jrjohnson","commitsCount":2},{"username":"jamescdavis","commitsCount":2},{"username":"rwjblue","commitsCount":12},{"username":"NullVoxPopuli","commitsCount":1},{"username":"bendemboski","commitsCount":4},{"username":"jenweber","commitsCount":1},{"username":"efx","commitsCount":1},{"username":"paddyobrien","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ctjhoa","commitsCount":2},{"username":"mattmcmanus","commitsCount":6},{"username":"dfreeman","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jelhan","commitsCount":9},{"username":"stukalin","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jacobq","commitsCount":1},{"username":"0xadada","commitsCount":1},{"username":"simonihmig","commitsCount":6},{"username":"stefanpenner","commitsCount":3},{"username":"Alonski","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ef4","commitsCount":465},{"username":"kasunvp","commitsCount":1},{"username":"nlfurniss","commitsCount":1},{"username":"kiwiupover","commitsCount":1},{"username":"knownasilya","commitsCount":1},{"username":"bobisjan","commitsCount":1},{"username":"MrChocolatine","commitsCount":2},{"username":"tmquinn","commitsCount":5},{"username":"boris-petrov","commitsCount":2},{"username":"cythrawll","commitsCount":4},{"username":"noslouch","commitsCount":1},{"username":"chadian","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Turbo87","commitsCount":2}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":7},{"from":"2021-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":28},{"from":"2021-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":43},{"from":"2021-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":188},{"from":"2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":272}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":15123,"testsSize":51803,"hasNpmIgnore":true,"hasChangelog":true},"linters":["eslint"],"outdatedDependencies":{"@embroider/shared-internals":{"required":"^0.40.0","stable":"0.43.5","latest":"0.44.0-alpha.2"},"mkdirp":{"required":"^0.5.1","stable":"1.0.4","latest":"0.5.5"},"walk-sync":{"required":"^0.3.3","stable":"3.0.0","latest":"3.0.0"},"rimraf":{"required":"^2.6.2","stable":"3.0.2","latest":"3.0.2"},"resolve-package-path":{"required":"^3.1.0","stable":"4.0.1","latest":"4.0.1"},"fs-extra":{"required":"^6.0.1","stable":"10.0.0","latest":"10.0.0"},"style-loader":{"required":"^2.0.0","stable":"3.2.1","latest":"3.2.1"},"css-loader":{"required":"^5.2.0","stable":"6.2.0","latest":"6.2.0"}}}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.9999999999999999,"tests":0.6,"health":0.5,"branding":0},"popularity":{"communityInterest":473,"downloadsCount":697200.3333333334,"downloadsAcceleration":1133.0845129375948,"dependentsCount":361},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":1,"commitsFrequency":1,"openIssues":0.9901960784313726,"issuesDistribution":0}},"score":{"final":0.5911206081186955,"detail":{"quality":0.7845531171991778,"popularity":0.34977527981732637,"maintenance":0.6666666429225083}}}
