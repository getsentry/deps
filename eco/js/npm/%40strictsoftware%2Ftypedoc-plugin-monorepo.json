This is then used to collect related items into one module.\n\nThis plugin is inspired by, and based on, [asgerjensen/typedoc-plugin-external-module-map](https://github.com/asgerjensen/typedoc-plugin-external-module-map). However, this plugin will automagically rename top-level modules discovered to a new \"Package\" type, and auto-discover and display READMEs for the individual packages. Furthermore, these packages are used as top-level entries in the table of contents.\n\nThis plugin is intended for monorepos that deliver more than one NPM package in a single Git repository.\n\nSuppose you have\n\n```\npackages/@namespace/package-1/index.ts\npackages/@namespace/package-1/src/otherfiles.ts\npackages/@namespace/package-2/index.ts\npackages/@namespace/package-2/src/otherfiles.ts\n```\n\nTypeDoc will create four \"Modules\", named for each .ts file.\n\n- \"@namespace/package-1/index\"\n- \"@namespace/package-1/src/otherfiles\"\n- \"@namespace/package-2/index\"\n- \"@namespace/package-2/src/otherfiles\"\n\nThis plugin allows each file to specify the TypeDoc Module its code should belong to. If multiple files belong to the same module, they are merged.\n\nThis allows more control over the modules that TypeDoc generates.\nInstead of the four modules above, we could group them into two:\n\n- @namespace/package-1\n- @namespace/package-2\n\nIn addition to grouping these modules, the plugin will attempt to discover README files in each module root to display with the documented package. In this plugin, top-level typedoc \"modules\" are renamed to the more semantic name \"packages\" in generated documentation.\n\n### Installing\n\nTypeDoc >=0.11 has the ability to discover and load typedoc plugins found in node_modules.\nSimply install the plugin and run typedoc.\n\n```\nnpm install --save @strictsoftware/typedoc-plugin-monorepo\ntypedoc\n```\n\n### Using\n\nThis plugin adds a new input option\n\n```\n--external-modulemap  \".*packages\\/(@namespace\\/[^\\/]+)\\/.*\"\n```\n\nIf you specify it from the command line, be sure to escape the input string so bash doesn't expand it.\n\nIt is probably easier to create a typedoc options file (typedoc.json) and add it there:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"My Library\",\n  \"out\": \"doc\",\n  \"theme\": \"default\",\n  \"preserveConstEnums\": \"true\",\n  \"exclude\": \"*.spec.ts\",\n  \"external-modulemap\": \".*packages\\/(@namespace\\/[^\\/]+)\\/.*\",\n  \"excludeExternals\": false\n}\n```"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","count":402},{"from":"2021-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","count":5831},{"from":"2021-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","count":19831},{"from":"2021-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","count":58586},{"from":"2021-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","count":100396},{"from":"2020-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","count":146855}],"dependentsCount":0,"starsCount":0},"github":{"forkOf":"gprzybylowicz/typedoc-plugin-monorepo","starsCount":14,"forksCount":12,"subscribersCount":1,"issues":{"count":11,"openCount":2,"distribution":{"3600":1,"10800":0,"32400":1,"97200":0,"291600":0,"874800":0,"2624400":2,"7873200":1,"23619600":4,"70858800":2,"212576400":0},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"amiller-gh","commitsCount":4},{"username":"haraldF","commitsCount":1},{"username":"asgerjensen","commitsCount":7},{"username":"gprzybylowicz","commitsCount":1},{"username":"yoursunny","commitsCount":1},{"username":"rbuckton","commitsCount":1},{"username":"unstubbable","commitsCount":18},{"username":"frio","commitsCount":1}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","count":8},{"from":"2020-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","count":8}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":2696,"testsSize":0,"hasNpmIgnore":true}}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.39499999999999996,"tests":0,"health":1,"branding":0},"popularity":{"communityInterest":35,"downloadsCount":19528.666666666668,"downloadsAcceleration":103.52598934550988,"dependentsCount":0},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":0.7958904109589041,"commitsFrequency":0.5120547945205479,"openIssues":1,"issuesDistribution":0}},"score":{"final":0.39372361145505796,"detail":{"quality":0.42985767279196835,"popularity":0.09320390585790313,"maintenance":0.6632712644777183}}}
