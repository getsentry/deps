Many of them are demoed at https://using-remark.gatsbyjs.org/. See also the [source code for using-remark](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-remark).\n\n## Parsing algorithm\n\nIt recognizes files with the following extensions as Markdown:\n\n- md\n- markdown\n\nEach Markdown file is parsed into a node of type `MarkdownRemark`.\n\nAll frontmatter fields are converted into GraphQL fields. TODO link to docs on\nauto-inferring types/fields.\n\nThis plugin adds additional fields to the `MarkdownRemark` GraphQL type\nincluding `html`, `excerpt`, `headings`, etc. Other Gatsby plugins can also add\nadditional fields.\n\n## How to query\n\nA sample GraphQL query to get MarkdownRemark nodes:\n\n```graphql\n{\n  allMarkdownRemark {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        html\n        headings {\n          depth\n          value\n        }\n        frontmatter {\n          # Assumes you're using title in your frontmatter.\n          title\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Getting table of contents\n\nUsing the following GraphQL query you'll be able to get the table of contents\n\n```graphql\n{\n  allMarkdownRemark {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        html\n        tableOfContents\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Configuring the tableOfContents\n\nBy default, `absolute` is set to false, generating a relative path. If you'd like to generate an absolute path, pass `absolute: true`. In that case, be sure to pass the `pathToSlugField` parameter, often `fields.slug`, to create absolute URLs. **Note** that providing a non-existent field will cause the result to be null. To alter the default values for tableOfContents generation, include values for `heading` (string) and/or `maxDepth` (number 1 to 6) in GraphQL query. If a value for `heading` is given, the first heading that matches will be omitted and the toc is generated from the next heading of the same depth onwards. Value for `maxDepth` sets the maximum depth of the toc (i.e. if a maxDepth of 3 is set, only h1 to h3 headings will appear in the toc).\n\n```graphql\n{\n  allMarkdownRemark {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        html\n        tableOfContents(\n          absolute: true\n          pathToSlugField: \"frontmatter.path\"\n          heading: \"only show toc from this heading onwards\"\n          maxDepth: 2\n        )\n        frontmatter {\n          # Assumes you're using path in your frontmatter.\n          path\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo pass default options to the plugin generating the tableOfContents, configure it in gatsby-config.js as shown below. The options shown below are the defaults used by the plugin.\n\n```javascript\n// In your gatsby-config.js\nplugins: [\n  {\n    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,\n    options: {\n      tableOfContents: {\n        heading: null,\n        maxDepth: 6,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n]\n```\n\n### Excerpts\n\n#### Length\n\nBy default, excerpts have a maximum length of 140 characters. You can change the default using the `pruneLength` argument. For example, if you need 500 characters, you can specify:\n\n```graphql\n{\n  allMarkdownRemark {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        html\n        excerpt(pruneLength: 500)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Format\n\nBy default, Gatsby will return excerpts as plain text. This might be useful for populating [opengraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Platform#Open_Graph_protocol) HTML tags for SEO reasons. You can also explicitly specify a `PLAIN` format like so:\n\n```graphql\n{\n  allMarkdownRemark {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        excerpt(format: PLAIN)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt's also possible to ask Gatsby to return excerpts formatted as HTML. You might use this if you have a blog post whose excerpt contains markdown content--e.g. header, link, etc.--and you want these links to render as HTML.\n\n```graphql\n{\n  allMarkdownRemark {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        excerpt(format: HTML)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can also get excerpts in Markdown format.\n\n```graphql\n{\n  allMarkdownRemark {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        excerpt(format: MARKDOWN)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## gray-matter options\n\n`gatsby-transformer-remark` uses [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) to parse markdown frontmatter, so you can specify any of the options mentioned [here](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter#options) in the `gatsby-config.js` file.\n\n### Example: Excerpts\n\nIf you don't want to use `pruneLength` for excerpts but a custom separator, you can specify an `excerpt_separator` in the `gatsby-config.js` file:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"resolve\": `gatsby-transformer-remark`,\n  \"options\": {\n    \"excerpt_separator\": `<!-- end -->`\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAny file that does not have the given `excerpt_separator` will fall back to the default pruning method.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Excerpts for non-latin languages\n\nBy default, `excerpt` uses `underscore.string/prune` which doesn't handle non-latin characters ([https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/issues/418](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/issues/418)).\n\nIf that is the case, you can set `truncate` option on `excerpt` field, like:\n\n```graphql\n{\n  markdownRemark {\n    excerpt(truncate: true)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Excerpts for HTML embedded in Markdown files\n\nIf your Markdown file contains HTML, `excerpt` will not return a value.\n\nIn that case, you can set an `excerpt_separator` in the `gatsby-config.js` file:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"resolve\": `gatsby-transformer-remark`,\n  \"options\": {\n    \"excerpt_separator\": `<!-- endexcerpt -->`\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEdit your Markdown files to include that HTML tag after the text you'd like to appear in the excerpt:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"my little pony\"\ndate: \"2017-09-18T23:19:51.246Z\"\n---\n\n<p>Where oh where is that pony?</p>\n<!-- endexcerpt -->\n<p>Is he in the stable or down by the stream?</p>\n```\n\nThen specify `MARKDOWN` as the format in your GraphQL query:\n\n```graphql\n{\n  markdownRemark {\n    excerpt(format: MARKDOWN)\n  }\n}\n```"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":19889},{"from":"2021-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":93750},{"from":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":449104},{"from":"2021-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":1554229},{"from":"2021-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":3307393},{"from":"2020-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":6566178}],"dependentsCount":367,"starsCount":2},"github":{"homepage":"https://www.gatsbyjs.com","starsCount":51195,"forksCount":9856,"subscribersCount":880,"issues":{"count":31487,"openCount":417,"distribution":{"3600":4955,"10800":2794,"32400":2869,"97200":4590,"291600":4059,"874800":3494,"2624400":2651,"7873200":3050,"23619600":2029,"70858800":956,"212576400":40},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"axe312ger","commitsCount":64},{"username":"nihgwu","commitsCount":30},{"username":"ascorbic","commitsCount":240},{"username":"devrchancay","commitsCount":13},{"username":"ThomasWang","commitsCount":17},{"username":"freiksenet","commitsCount":119},{"username":"caitlinthefirst","commitsCount":16},{"username":"davidbailey00","commitsCount":67},{"username":"resir014","commitsCount":17},{"username":"hashimwarren","commitsCount":51},{"username":"DSchau","commitsCount":354},{"username":"amberleyromo","commitsCount":112},{"username":"Khaledgarbaya","commitsCount":27},{"username":"jbolda","commitsCount":22},{"username":"Simply007","commitsCount":14},{"username":"mgienow","commitsCount":84},{"username":"fabien0102","commitsCount":13},{"username":"polarathene","commitsCount":12},{"username":"phacks","commitsCount":13},{"username":"tesseralis","commitsCount":158},{"username":"me4502","commitsCount":16},{"username":"renovate[bot]","commitsCount":116},{"username":"daydream05","commitsCount":16},{"username":"smthomas","commitsCount":12},{"username":"Slashgear","commitsCount":17},{"username":"scottyeck","commitsCount":20},{"username":"MichaelDeBoey","commitsCount":24},{"username":"LekoArts","commitsCount":379},{"username":"ChangoMan","commitsCount":12},{"username":"0x80","commitsCount":32},{"username":"coreyward","commitsCount":13},{"username":"sasurau4","commitsCount":12},{"username":"TylerBarnes","commitsCount":67},{"username":"greglobinski","commitsCount":21},{"username":"DanielSLew","commitsCount":20},{"username":"erquhart","commitsCount":19},{"username":"jbampton","commitsCount":76},{"username":"oorestisime","commitsCount":26},{"username":"duffn","commitsCount":23},{"username":"fk","commitsCount":217},{"username":"kawamataryo","commitsCount":13},{"username":"jamo","commitsCount":56},{"username":"johno","commitsCount":75},{"username":"Ekwuno","commitsCount":22},{"username":"lannonbr","commitsCount":89},{"username":"NickyMeuleman","commitsCount":14},{"username":"jquense","commitsCount":110},{"username":"wardpeet","commitsCount":444},{"username":"muescha","commitsCount":301},{"username":"cassiebeckley","commitsCount":16},{"username":"webinista","commitsCount":23},{"username":"dandv","commitsCount":21},{"username":"hoobdeebla","commitsCount":23},{"username":"meganesu","commitsCount":38},{"username":"jlengstorf","commitsCount":47},{"username":"laurieontech","commitsCount":150},{"username":"madalynrose","commitsCount":16},{"username":"docwhat","commitsCount":14},{"username":"Moocar","commitsCount":51},{"username":"benjaminhoffman","commitsCount":14},{"username":"Js-Brecht","commitsCount":17},{"username":"mottox2","commitsCount":64},{"username":"mathieudutour","commitsCount":13},{"username":"iamtraction","commitsCount":9},{"username":"ChristopherBiscardi","commitsCount":186},{"username":"ollelauribostrom","commitsCount":13},{"username":"pieh","commitsCount":842},{"username":"mxstbr","commitsCount":96},{"username":"gillkyle","commitsCount":107},{"username":"dennari","commitsCount":12},{"username":"calcsam","commitsCount":133},{"username":"pvdz","commitsCount":240},{"username":"janosh","commitsCount":22},{"username":"blainekasten","commitsCount":95},{"username":"m-allanson","commitsCount":354},{"username":"kripod","commitsCount":15},{"username":"ehowey","commitsCount":16},{"username":"shannonbux","commitsCount":268},{"username":"elrumordelaluz","commitsCount":13},{"username":"kkemple","commitsCount":26},{"username":"benstepp","commitsCount":27},{"username":"stefanprobst","commitsCount":138},{"username":"alexandernanberg","commitsCount":25},{"username":"anubhavsrivastava","commitsCount":16},{"username":"abhiaiyer91","commitsCount":13},{"username":"gesposito","commitsCount":13},{"username":"moonmeister","commitsCount":27},{"username":"abhishekjakhar","commitsCount":33},{"username":"sebastienfi","commitsCount":35},{"username":"sidharthachatterjee","commitsCount":433},{"username":"arcanis","commitsCount":23},{"username":"ooloth","commitsCount":18},{"username":"marcysutton","commitsCount":24},{"username":"szime
