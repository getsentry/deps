Include the plugin in your `gatsby-config.js` file.\n\n```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js\nplugins: [`gatsby-plugin-sass`]\n```\n\n2. Write your stylesheets in Sass/SCSS and require or import them as normal.\n\n```scss:title=src/index.scss\nhtml {\n  background-color: rebeccapurple;\n  p {\n    color: white;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```javascript:title=gatsby-browser.js\nimport \"./src/index.scss\"\n```\n\n## Other options\n\nIf you need to pass options to Sass use the plugins options, see [`node-sass`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)/[`dart-sass`](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass) docs\nfor all available options.\n\n```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js\nplugins: [\n  {\n    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-sass`,\n    options: {\n      sassOptions: {\n        includePaths: [\"absolute/path/a\", \"absolute/path/b\"],\n        ...\n      }\n    },\n  },\n]\n```\n\nIf you need to override the default options passed into [`css-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader).\n**Note:** Gatsby is using `css-loader@^5.0.0`.\n\n```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js\nplugins: [\n  {\n    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-sass`,\n    options: {\n      cssLoaderOptions: {\n        camelCase: false,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n]\n```\n\n### Alternative Sass Implementations\n\nBy default, the Dart implementation of Sass (`sass`) is used. To use the implementation written in Node (`node-sass`), you can install `node-sass` instead of `sass` and pass it into the options as the implementation:\n\n```shell\nnpm install node-sass\n```\n\n```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js\nplugins: [\n  {\n    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-sass`,\n    options: {\n      implementation: require(\"node-sass\"),\n    },\n  },\n]\n```\n\n### Sass Precision\n\n`sass` intentionally doesn't have support for setting a custom `precision`. `node-sass` defaults to [5 digits of precision](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#precision). If you want some other level of precision (e.g. if you use Bootstrap), you may configure it as follows:\n\n#### Bootstrap 4\n\nSee [Bootstrap's documentation on theming](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/theming/#sass) for reference.\n\n```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js\nplugins: [\n  {\n    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-sass`,\n    options: {\n      implementation: require(\"node-sass\"),\n      postCssPlugins: [somePostCssPlugin()],\n      sassOptions: {\n        precision: 6,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n]\n```\n\n#### Bootstrap 3 (with `bootstrap-sass`)\n\nSee [`bootstrap-sass`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/README.md#sass-number-precision) for reference.\n\n```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js\nplugins: [\n  {\n    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-sass`,\n    options: {\n      implementation: require(\"node-sass\"),\n      postCssPlugins: [somePostCssPlugin()],\n      sassOptions: {\n        precision: 8,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n]\n```\n\n### With CSS Modules\n\nUsing CSS Modules requires no additional configuration. Simply prepend `.module` to the extension. For example: `app.scss` -> `app.module.scss`.\nAny file with the `module` extension will use CSS Modules. CSS modules are imported as ES Modules to support treeshaking. You'll need to import styles as: `import { yourClassName, anotherClassName } from './app.module.scss'`\n\n## Sass & CSS Modules file Regexes\n\nTo override the file regex for Sass or CSS modules,\n\n```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js\nplugins: [\n  {\n    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-sass`,\n    options: {\n      // Override the file regex for Sass\n      sassRuleTest: /\\.global\\.s(a|c)ss$/,\n      // Override the file regex for CSS modules\n      sassRuleModulesTest: /\\.mod\\.s(a|c)ss$/,\n    },\n  },\n]\n```\n\n### PostCSS plugins\n\nPostCSS is also included to handle some default optimizations like autoprefixing\nand common cross-browser flexbox bugs. Normally you don't need to think about it, but if\nyou'd prefer to add additional postprocessing to your Sass output you can specify plugins\nin the plugin options.\n\n## Relative paths & `url()`\n\nThis plugin resolves `url()` paths relative to the entry SCSS/Sass file not – as might be expected – the location relative to the declaration. Under the hood, it makes use of [`sass-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/README.md#problems-with-url) and this is documented in the [readme](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/README.md#problems-with-url).\n\nUsing [`resolve-url-loader`](https://github.com/bholloway/resolve-url-loader) provides a workaround, if you want to use relative url just install the plugin and then add it to your Sass plugin options configuration.\n\nFirst:\n\n```shell\nnpm install resolve-url-loader --save-dev\n```\n\nAnd then:\n\n```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js\nplugins: [\n  {\n    resolve: \"gatsby-plugin-sass\",\n    options: {\n      useResolveUrlLoader: true,\n    },\n  },\n]\n```\n\nYou can also configure `resolve-url-plugin` providing some options (see [plugin documentation](https://github.com/bholloway/resolve-url-loader) for all options):\n\n```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js\nplugins: [\n  {\n    resolve: \"gatsby-plugin-sass\",\n    options: {\n      useResolveUrlLoader: {\n        options: {\n          debug: true,\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n]\n```\n\n**Please note:** Adding `resolve-url-loader` will use `sourceMap: true` on `sass-loader` (as it is required for the plugin to work), you can then activate/deactivate source-map for Sass files in the plugin:\n\n```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js\nplugins: [\n  {\n    resolve: \"gatsby-plugin-sass\",\n    options: {\n      useResolveUrlLoader: {\n        options: {\n          sourceMap: true, //default is false\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n]\n```\n\n## Breaking changes history\n\n<!-- Please keep the breaking changes list ordered with the newest change at the top -->\n\n### v3.0.0\n\n- `sass-loader` is updated to v10 which adds support for `node-sass@^5.0.0` but also switches the default `implementation` to `sass`. webpack also recommends using `sass` so this is reflected in the documentation here, too. In the [deprecation notice of node-sass](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated#how-do-i-migrate) it is noted that switching from `node-sass` to `sass` is straightforward as both packages use the same JavaScript API.\n- All options for both [`node-sass`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#options) & [`sass`](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/master/README.md#javascript-api) are moved into the `sassOptions` object\n- You're now able to override the `importLoaders` option. If you have this in your options but don't intend to override it, you'll need to remove it\n\n### v2.0.0\n\n- `node-sass` is moved to a peer dependency. Installing the package\n  alongside `gatsby-plugin-sass` is now required. Use `npm install node-sass`\n\n- support Gatsby v2 only"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":19917},{"from":"2021-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":97934},{"from":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":468012},{"from":"2021-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":1568297},{"from":"2021-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":3429850},{"from":"2020-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","count":6921387}],"dependentsCount":197,"starsCount":2},"github":{"homepage":"https://www.gatsbyjs.com","starsCount":51195,"forksCount":9856,"subscribersCount":880,"issues":{"count":31487,"openCount":417,"distribution":{"3600":4955,"10800":2794,"32400":2869,"97200":4591,"291600":4058,"874800":3494,"2624400":2651,"7873200":3050,"23619600":2029,"70858800":956,"212576400":40},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"laurieontech","commitsCount":150},{"username":"nihgwu","commitsCount":30},{"username":"ascorbic","commitsCount":240},{"username":"devrchancay","commitsCount":13},{"username":"ThomasWang","commitsCount":17},{"username":"freiksenet","commitsCount":119},{"username":"caitlinthefirst","commitsCount":16},{"username":"davidbailey00","commitsCount":67},{"username":"resir014","commitsCount":17},{"username":"hashimwarren","commitsCount":51},{"username":"DSchau","commitsCount":354},{"username":"amberleyromo","commitsCount":112},{"username":"Khaledgarbaya","commitsCount":27},{"username":"jbolda","commitsCount":22},{"username":"Simply007","commitsCount":14},{"username":"ooloth","commitsCount":18},{"username":"fabien0102","commitsCount":13},{"username":"polarathene","commitsCount":12},{"username":"arcanis","commitsCount":23},{"username":"tesseralis","commitsCount":158},{"username":"me4502","commitsCount":16},{"username":"renovate[bot]","commitsCount":116},{"username":"daydream05","commitsCount":16},{"username":"smthomas","commitsCount":12},{"username":"Slashgear","commitsCount":17},{"username":"scottyeck","commitsCount":20},{"username":"KyleAMathews","commitsCount":2980},{"username":"LekoArts","commitsCount":379},{"username":"ChangoMan","commitsCount":12},{"username":"0x80","commitsCount":32},{"username":"coreyward","commitsCount":13},{"username":"sasurau4","commitsCount":12},{"username":"TylerBarnes","commitsCount":67},{"username":"greglobinski","commitsCount":21},{"username":"DanielSLew","commitsCount":20},{"username":"erquhart","commitsCount":19},{"username":"jbampton","commitsCount":76},{"username":"oorestisime","commitsCount":26},{"username":"duffn","commitsCount":23},{"username":"fk","commitsCount":217},{"username":"kawamataryo","commitsCount":13},{"username":"jamo","commitsCount":56},{"username":"johno","commitsCount":75},{"username":"Ekwuno","commitsCount":22},{"username":"lannonbr","commitsCount":89},{"username":"herecydev","commitsCount":23},{"username":"blainekasten","commitsCount":95},{"username":"anubhavsrivastava","commitsCount":16},{"username":"cassiebeckley","commitsCount":16},{"username":"webinista","commitsCount":23},{"username":"dandv","commitsCount":21},{"username":"hoobdeebla","commitsCount":23},{"username":"vladar","commitsCount":235},{"username":"meganesu","commitsCount":38},{"username":"jlengstorf","commitsCount":47},{"username":"madalynrose","commitsCount":16},{"username":"docwhat","commitsCount":14},{"username":"Moocar","commitsCount":51},{"username":"benjaminhoffman","commitsCount":14},{"username":"sebastienfi","commitsCount":35},{"username":"mottox2","commitsCount":64},{"username":"mathieudutour","commitsCount":13},{"username":"mgienow","commitsCount":84},{"username":"iamtraction","commitsCount":9},{"username":"ChristopherBiscardi","commitsCount":186},{"username":"ollelauribostrom","commitsCount":13},{"username":"mxstbr","commitsCount":96},{"username":"gillkyle","commitsCount":107},{"username":"dennari","commitsCount":12},{"username":"calcsam","commitsCount":133},{"username":"pvdz","commitsCount":240},{"username":"janosh","commitsCount":22},{"username":"shannonbux","commitsCount":268},{"username":"m-allanson","commitsCount":354},{"username":"kripod","commitsCount":15},{"username":"ehowey","commitsCount":16},{"username":"CanRau","commitsCount":18},{"username":"stefanprobst","commitsCount":138},{"username":"elrumordelaluz","commitsCount":13},{"username":"benstepp","commitsCount":27},{"username":"alexandernanberg","commitsCount":25},{"username":"abhishekjakhar","commitsCount":33},{"username":"jquense","commitsCount":110},{"username":"gesposito","commitsCount":13},{"username":"moonmeister","commitsCount":27},{"username":"muescha","commitsCount":301},{"username":"phacks","commitsCount":13},{"username":"abhiaiyer91","commitsCount":13},{"username":"szimek","commitsCount":12},{"username":"wardpeet","commitsCount":444},{"username":"MichaelDeBoey","commitsCount":24},{"username":"tsriram","commitsCount":29},{"username":"marcysutton","commitsCount":24},{"username":"avigoldman","commitsCoun
