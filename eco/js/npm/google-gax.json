If you need to use this library with older versions of Node.js, you need to make your code depend\non a legacy gRPC library ([grpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grpc)) and pass the instance of gRPC to the client constructor:\n\n```js\nconst grpc = require('grpc');\nconst client = new APIClient({ grpc }); // APIClient is the client class you use, e.g. SpeechClient, etc.\n```\n\n## Contributing\nContributions to this library are always welcome and highly encouraged.  See the [CONTRIBUTING][contributing] documentation for more information on how to get started.\n\n## Details\nFor detailed documentation of the modules in gax-nodejs, please check out the [docs][docs].\n\n## License\nBSD - See [LICENSE][license] for more information.\n\n[codecovimg]: https://codecov.io/gh/googleapis/gax-nodejs/coverage.svg?branch=master\n[codecov]:
