this addon will disable Ember's prototype extensions.\n\nThis is a great idea for addon authors to ensure that their addon does not accidentally depend upon prototype extensions (which may be disabled in a consuming application).\n\nFor instructions on disabling prototype extensions see the Ember guide:\n\nhttp://guides.emberjs.com/v1.11.0/configuring-ember/disabling-prototype-extensions/\n\n## Installation \n\n```sh\nember install ember-disable-prototype-extensions\n```\n\n## Collaboration\n\n### Setup\n\n* `git clone` this repository\n* `npm install`\n* `bower install`\n\n### Running Tests\n\n* `npm test` (Runs `ember try:testall` to test your addon against multiple Ember versions)\n* `ember test`\n* `ember test --server`"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","count":1739},{"from":"2021-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","count":46211},{"from":"2021-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","count":206046},{"from":"2021-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","count":623737},{"from":"2021-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","count":1212630},{"from":"2020-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","count":2290783}],"dependentsCount":4,"starsCount":0},"github":{"starsCount":6,"forksCount":6,"subscribersCount":6,"issues":{"count":259,"openCount":21,"distribution":{"3600":49,"10800":14,"32400":6,"97200":15,"291600":18,"874800":39,"2624400":42,"7873200":51,"23619600":14,"70858800":11,"212576400":0},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"nathanhammond","commitsCount":2},{"username":"dependabot-preview[bot]","commitsCount":3},{"username":"dependabot[bot]","commitsCount":20},{"username":"ember-tomster","commitsCount":1},{"username":"rwjblue","commitsCount":7},{"username":"Turbo87","commitsCount":11},{"username":"stefanpenner","commitsCount":6}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2020-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","count":0}],"statuses":[{"context":"continuous-integration/travis-ci/push","state":"error"},{"context":"continuous-integration/appveyor/branch","state":"success"}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":1123,"testsSize":7680,"hasNpmIgnore":true},"badges":[{"urls":{"original":"https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/ember-disable-prototype-extensions.svg?branch=master","service":"https://api.travis-ci.org/ember-cli/ember-disable-prototype-extensions.svg?branch=master","shields":"https://img.shields.io/travis/ember-cli/ember-disable-prototype-extensions/master.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/travis/ember-cli/ember-disable-prototype-extensions/master.json"},"info":{"service":"travis","type":"build","modifiers":{"branch":"master"}}},{"urls":{"original":"https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xvg1fxk24lh5u0eg/branch/master?svg=true","service":"https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xvg1fxk24lh5u0eg/branch/master","shields":"https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/xvg1fxk24lh5u0eg/branch/master.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/xvg1fxk24lh5u0eg/branch/master.json"},"info":{"service":"appveyor","type":"build"}}],"linters":["editorconfig","eslint","jshint"]}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.9199999999999999,"tests":0.725,"health":1,"branding":0.3},"popularity":{"communityInterest":25,"downloadsCount":207912.33333333334,"downloadsAcceleration":263.1994292237441,"dependentsCount":4},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":0,"commitsFrequency":0,"openIssues":1,"issuesDistribution":0.7654255605036855}},"score":{"final":0.5152250608606186,"detail":{"quality":0.9481637469477713,"popularity":0.1601137975707996,"maintenance":0.4992460217900212}}}
