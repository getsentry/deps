This helps ensure the version you're using is stable\nand thoroughly tested._\n\n_If you do want to build from source, make sure you clone the latest tag!_\n\n## Usage\n\n### 1. Add the script to your page\n\n```html\n    ...\n    <script src=\"/node_modules/focus-visible/dist/focus-visible.min.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### 2. Update your CSS\n\nWe suggest that users\nselectively disable the default focus style\nby selecting for the case when the polyfill is loaded\nand `.focus-visible` is _not_ applied to the element:\n\n```css\n/*\n  This will hide the focus indicator if the element receives focus via the mouse,\n  but it will still show up on keyboard focus.\n*/\n.js-focus-visible :focus:not(.focus-visible) {\n  outline: none;\n}\n```\n\nIf there are elements which should always have a focus ring shown,\nauthors may explicitly add the `focus-visible` class.\nIf explicitly added, it will not be removed on `blur`.\n\nAlternatively, if you're using a framework which overwrites your classes ([#179](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible/issues/179)),\nyou can rely on the `data-js-focus-visible` and `data-focus-visible-added` attributes.\n```css\n[data-js-focus-visible] :focus:not([data-focus-visible-added]) {\n  outline: none;\n}\n```\n\n### How it works\n\nThe script uses two heuristics to determine whether the keyboard is being (or will be) used:\n\n- a `focus` event immediately following a `keydown` event where the key pressed was either `Tab`,\n`Shift + Tab`, or an arrow key.\n\n- focus moves into an element which requires keyboard interaction,\n  such as a text field\n\n  - NOTE: this means that HTML elements like `<input type={text|email|password|...}>` or `<textarea>` will **always** match the `:focus-visible` selector, regardless of whether they are focused via a keyboard or a mouse.\n\n- _TODO: ideally, we also trigger keyboard modality\n  following a keyboard event which activates an element or causes a mutation;\n  this still needs to be implemented._\n\n### Dependencies\n\nIf you want to use `:focus-visible` with an older browser you'll need to include an additional polyfill for [`Element.prototype.classList`](https://caniuse.com/#feat=classlist).\n\nIn accordance with the W3C's new [polyfill\nguidance](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/polyfills/#don-t-serve-unnecessary-polyfills), the\n`:focus-visible` polyfill does not bundle other polyfills.\n\nYou can use a service like [Polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io) to download only the polyfills needed by the current browser. Just add the following line to the start of your page:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=Element.prototype.classList\"></script>\n```\n\n### Shadow DOM\n\nIt could be very expensive to apply this polyfill automatically to every shadow\nroot that is created in a given document, so the polyfill ignores shadow roots\nby default. If you are using Shadow DOM in a component, it is possible to apply\nthis polyfill imperatively to the component's shadow root:\n\n```javascript\n// Check for the polyfill:\nif (window.applyFocusVisiblePolyfill != null) {\n  window.applyFocusVisiblePolyfill(myComponent.shadowRoot);\n}\n```\n\n### Lazy-loading\n\nWhen this polyfill is lazy-loaded, and you are applying the polyfill to a shadow\nroot with JavaScript, it is important to know when the polyfill has become\navailable before trying to use it.\n\nIn order to act at the right time, you can observe the global\n`focus-visible-polyfill-ready` event:\n\n```javascript\nwindow.addEventListener('focus-visible-polyfill-ready',\n    () => window.applyFocusVisiblePolyfill(myComponent.shadowRoot),\n    { once:  true });\n```\n\n**Important:** this event is _only_ intended to support late application of the\npolyfill in lazy-loading use cases. Do not write code that depends on the event\nfiring, as it is timing dependent and only fired once. If you plan to lazy-load\nthe polyfill, it is recommended that you check for it synchronously (see example\nabove under \"Shadow DOM\") and listen for the event only if the polyfill isn't\navailable yet.\n\n# Backwards compatibility\nUntil all browsers ship `:focus-visible` developers will need to use it defensively to avoid accidentally\nremoving focus styles in legacy browsers. This is easy to do with the polyfill.\n\n```css\n/*\n  This will hide the focus indicator if the element receives focus via the mouse,\n  but it will still show up on keyboard focus.\n*/\n.js-focus-visible :focus:not(.focus-visible) {\n  outline: none;\n}\n\n/*\n  Optionally: Define a strong focus indicator for keyboard focus.\n  If you choose to skip this step then the browser's default focus\n  indicator will be displayed instead.\n*/\n.js-focus-visible .focus-visible {\n  …\n}\n```\n\nAs [explained by the Paciello Group](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2018/03/focus-visible-and-backwards-compatibility/), developers who don't use the polyfill can still defensively rely on `:focus-visible` using the\nfollowing snippet:\n\n```css\n/*\n  Provide basic, default focus styles.\n*/\nbutton:focus {\n  …\n}\n\n/*\n  Remove default focus styles for mouse users ONLY if\n  :focus-visible is supported on this platform.\n*/\nbutton:focus:not(:focus-visible) {\n  …\n}\n\n/*\n  Optionally: If :focus-visible is supported on this\n  platform, provide enhanced focus styles for keyboard\n  focus.\n*/\nbutton:focus-visible {\n  …\n}\n```\n\nIn the future, when all browsers support `:focus-visible`, the\nsnippets above will be unnecessary. But until that time it's important\nto be mindful when you use `:focus-visible` and to ensure you always\nhave a fallback strategy.\n\n### Big Thanks\n\nCross-browser Testing Platform and Open Source <3 Provided by [Sauce Labs][homepage]\n\n<a href=\"https://saucelabs.com\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/f2cK9ZQ.jpg\" width=\"200\"></a>\n\n[homepage]: https://saucelabs.com"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":251415},{"from":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":1202247},{"from":"2021-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":3826039},{"from":"2021-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":7522875},{"from":"2020-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":12547603}],"dependentsCount":152,"starsCount":3},"github":{"homepage":"https://wicg.github.io/focus-visible/demo/","starsCount":1428,"forksCount":114,"subscribersCount":34,"issues":{"count":258,"openCount":41,"distribution":{"3600":26,"10800":14,"32400":23,"97200":23,"291600":24,"874800":38,"2624400":33,"7873200":23,"23619600":21,"70858800":19,"212576400":14},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"josemarluedke","commitsCount":1},{"username":"boriskor","commitsCount":1},{"username":"stefanjudis","commitsCount":1},{"username":"robdodson","commitsCount":80},{"username":"ivoilic","commitsCount":2},{"username":"greenkeeper[bot]","commitsCount":41},{"username":"thebuilder","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Justineo","commitsCount":1},{"username":"eps1lon","commitsCount":1},{"username":"marcoscaceres","commitsCount":1},{"username":"oatymart","commitsCount":1},{"username":"shans","commitsCount":1},{"username":"DanielRuf","commitsCount":3},{"username":"alice","commitsCount":40},{"username":"wojtekmaj","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Westbrook","commitsCount":1},{"username":"darrylblake","commitsCount":1},{"username":"yoanmalie","commitsCount":1},{"username":"yoavweiss","commitsCount":5},{"username":"matharden","commitsCount":1},{"username":"kloots","commitsCount":7},{"username":"dimitrinicolas","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Fyzu","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jwyung","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jonathantneal","commitsCount":1},{"username":"nelonoel","commitsCount":1},{"username":"bkardell","commitsCount":29},{"username":"plinehan","commitsCount":2},{"username":"tinymachine","commitsCount":1},{"username":"dontcallmedom","commitsCount":1},{"username":"cdata","commitsCount":2},{"username":"travisleithead","commitsCount":1},{"username":"patrickhlauke","commitsCount":2},{"username":"oliviertassinari","commitsCount":1}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":1},{"from":"2020-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","count":3}],"statuses":[{"context":"continuous-integration/travis-ci/push","state":"success"},{"context":"github/pages","state":"success"}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":7022,"testsSize":54946},"badges":[{"urls":{"original":"https://travis-ci.org/WICG/focus-visible.svg?branch=master","service":"https://api.travis-ci.org/WICG/focus-visible.svg?branch=master","shields":"https://img.shields.io/travis/WICG/focus-visible/master.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/travis/WICG/focus-visible/master.json"},"info":{"service":"travis","type":"build","modifiers":{"branch":"master"}}}],"linters":["eslint","prettier"]}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.84,"tests":0.85,"health":1,"branding":0.15},"popularity":{"communityInterest":1613,"downloadsCount":1275346.3333333333,"downloadsAcceleration":3278.6652397260277,"dependentsCount":152},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":0.1356164383561644,"commitsFrequency":0.08702054794520547,"openIssues":1,"issuesDistribution":0}},"score":{"final":0.554501332838486,"detail":{"quality":0.94515359707523,"popularity":0.39610906705308,"maintenance":0.378048800706683}}}
