So this repository is a fork of `react-router@3.2` with following changes:\n\n- Case sensitive routes `<Route ... sensitive />`\n\n<img src=\"/logo/vertical@2x.png\" height=\"150\"/>\n\nReact Router is a complete routing library for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).\n\nReact Router keeps your UI in sync with the URL. It has a simple API with powerful features like lazy code loading, dynamic route matching, and location transition handling built right in. Make the URL your first thought, not an after-thought.\n\n[![Codecov][codecov-badge]][codecov]\n[![Discord][discord-badge]][discord]\n\n### 4.0 is here!\n\nThe next version of React Router (4.0) has been released! Check out the `master` branch.\n\n[4.0 Documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)\n\n### Docs & Help\n\n- [Tutorial – do this first!](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-tutorial)\n- [Guides and API docs (v2, v3)](/docs)\n- [Troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md)\n- [Changelog](/CHANGES.md)\n- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-router)\n- [CodePen boilerplate](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xwQZdy?editors=001) for bug reports\n\n**Older Versions:**\n\n- 0.13.x - [docs](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v0.13.6/doc) / [guides](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v0.13.6/docs/guides) / [code](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v0.13.6) / [upgrade guide](/upgrade-guides/v1.0.0.md)\n- 1.0.x - [docs](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/1.0.x/docs) / [code](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/1.0.x) / [upgrade guide](/upgrade-guides/v2.0.0.md)\n\nFor questions and support, please visit [our channel on Reactiflux](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bYaNQ46) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-router).\n\n### Browser Support\n\nWe support all browsers and environments where React runs.\n\n### Installation\n\nUsing [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n    $ npm install --save react-router\n\nThen with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) that supports either CommonJS or ES2015 modules, use as you would anything else:\n\n```js\n// using an ES6 transpiler, like babel\nimport { Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router'\n\n// not using an ES6 transpiler\nvar Router = require('react-router').Router\nvar Route = require('react-router').Route\nvar Link = require('react-router').Link\n```\n\nThe UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-router/umd/ReactRouter.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nYou can find the library on `window.ReactRouter`.\n\n### What's it look like?\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { render } from 'react-dom'\nimport { Router, Route, Link, browserHistory } from 'react-router'\n\nconst App = React.createClass({/*...*/})\nconst About = React.createClass({/*...*/})\nconst NoMatch = React.createClass({/*...*/})\n\nconst Users = React.createClass({\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <h1>Users</h1>\n        <div className=\"master\">\n          <ul>\n            {/* use Link to route around the app */}\n            {this.state.users.map(user => (\n              <li key={user.id}><Link to={`/user/${user.id}`}>{user.name}</Link></li>\n            ))}\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"detail\">\n          {this.props.children}\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nconst User = React.createClass({\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.setState({\n      // route components are rendered with useful information, like URL params\n      user: findUserById(this.props.params.userId)\n    })\n  },\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <h2>{this.state.user.name}</h2>\n        {/* etc. */}\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\n// Declarative route configuration (could also load this config lazily\n// instead, all you really need is a single root route, you don't need to\n// colocate the entire config).\nrender((\n  <Router history={browserHistory}>\n    <Route path=\"/\" component={App}>\n      <Route path=\"about\" component={About}/>\n      <Route path=\"users\" component={Users}>\n        <Route path=\"/user/:userId\" component={User}/>\n      </Route>\n      <Route path=\"*\" component={NoMatch}/>\n    </Route>\n  </Router>\n), document.getElementById('root'))\n```\n\nSee more in the [Introduction](/docs/Introduction.md), [Guides](/docs/guides/README.md), and [Examples](/examples).\n\n### Versioning and Stability\n\nWe want React Router to be a stable dependency that’s easy to keep current. We take the same approach to versioning as React.js itself: [React Versioning Scheme](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/02/19/new-versioning-scheme.html).\n\n### Thanks\n\nThanks to [our sponsors](/SPONSORS.md) for supporting the development of\nReact Router.\n\nReact Router was initially inspired by Ember's fantastic router. Many thanks to the Ember team.\n\nAlso, thanks to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for providing the infrastructure that allows us to run our build in real browsers.\n\n[build-badge]:
