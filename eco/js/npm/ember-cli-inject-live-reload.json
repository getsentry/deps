This allows Ember CLI to notify the browser to trigger a refresh after JavaScript or style changes.\n\n## Configuration\n\nFor vanilla Ember CLI apps, no configuration is required.\n\nThe following options are supported via command line arguments or the `.ember-cli` file:\n\n|Option|Purpose|\n|------|-------|\n| `liveReload` | Defaults to `true` during `ember serve`. Set to `false` to prevent the livereload script tag from being injected. |\n| `liveReloadPort` | Specifies the port that `ember-cli-live-reload.js` and `livereload.js` are loaded from  |\n| `liveReloadHost` | The host that `ember-cli-live-reload.js` will be loaded from |\n| `liveReloadPrefix` | The url prefix which will be prepended before `livereload.js` |\n\nThe following options are supported via the `.ember-cli` file:\n\n|Option|Purpose|\n|------|-------|\n| `liveReloadJsUrl` | The absolute URL used to load `livereload.js`. If specified, this overrides the `liveReloadPort` option.  |\n| `liveReloadOptions` | JavaScript object for LiveReload options. LiveReload supports a number of [options](https://github.com/livereload/livereload-js#options) for configuring websocket communication, including `https`, `host`, `port`, and others. See advanced example below. |\n\n## Advanced Example Configuration\n\n**NOTE:** Most apps will be fine with _no_ special configuration. Only use this sort of configuration if you have reason to override the default LiveReload websocket behavior. A use case for this is serving Ember CLI apps in development via a reverse proxy such as nginx.\n\n##### .ember-cli\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"liveReloadPort\": 37531,\n\n  // This `liveReloadOptions` property becomes `window.LiveReloadOptions`\n  \"liveReloadOptions\": {\n    \"port\": 37631,\n    \"https\": true,\n    \"host\": \"your-hostname.dev\"\n  },\n\n  \"liveReloadJsUrl\": \"https://your-hostname.dev/livereload.js\"\n}\n```"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","count":25057},{"from":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","count":143646},{"from":"2021-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","count":607561},{"from":"2021-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","count":1744698},{"from":"2021-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","count":3680871},{"from":"2020-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","count":6755210}],"dependentsCount":14,"starsCount":0},"github":{"forkOf":"ember-cli/ember-cli-inject-live-reload","starsCount":0,"forksCount":0,"subscribersCount":0,"issues":{"count":0,"openCount":0,"distribution":{"3600":0,"10800":0,"32400":0,"97200":0,"291600":0,"874800":0,"2624400":0,"7873200":0,"23619600":0,"70858800":0,"212576400":0},"isDisabled":true},"contributors":[{"username":"rwjblue","commitsCount":51},{"username":"dependabot-preview[bot]","commitsCount":1},{"username":"buschtoens","commitsCount":2},{"username":"JohnQuaresma","commitsCount":1},{"username":"2hu12","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jgoclawski","commitsCount":3},{"username":"chrislopresto","commitsCount":3},{"username":"lukemelia","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jbescoyez","commitsCount":2},{"username":"Dremora","commitsCount":1},{"username":"dependabot[bot]","commitsCount":11},{"username":"unwiredbrain","commitsCount":1},{"username":"teddyzeenny","commitsCount":1},{"username":"quaertym","commitsCount":1},{"username":"kratiahuja","commitsCount":2},{"username":"Turbo87","commitsCount":7},{"username":"stefanpenner","commitsCount":4}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2020-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","count":0}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":2313,"testsSize":5654,"hasChangelog":true},"linters":["eslint"],"outdatedDependencies":{"ember-cli-version-checker":{"required":"^3.1.3","stable":"5.1.2","latest":"5.1.2"}}}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.9999999999999999,"tests":0.6,"health":0.75,"branding":0},"popularity":{"communityInterest":17,"downloadsCount":581566,"downloadsAcceleration":921.6168378995426,"dependentsCount":14},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":0.9,"commitsFrequency":0.9,"openIssues":0.9,"issuesDistribution":0.9}},"score":{"final":0.6728897217417827,"detail":{"quality":0.8359814206057153,"popularity":0.20612136344855117,"maintenance":0.9998651952945008}}}
