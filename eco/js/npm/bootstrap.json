You'll see something like this:\n\n```text\nbootstrap/\n├── css/\n│   ├── bootstrap-grid.css\n│   ├── bootstrap-grid.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap-grid.min.css\n│   ├── bootstrap-grid.min.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap-grid.rtl.css\n│   ├── bootstrap-grid.rtl.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap-grid.rtl.min.css\n│   ├── bootstrap-grid.rtl.min.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap-reboot.css\n│   ├── bootstrap-reboot.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap-reboot.min.css\n│   ├── bootstrap-reboot.min.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap-reboot.rtl.css\n│   ├── bootstrap-reboot.rtl.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap-reboot.rtl.min.css\n│   ├── bootstrap-reboot.rtl.min.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap-utilities.css\n│   ├── bootstrap-utilities.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap-utilities.min.css\n│   ├── bootstrap-utilities.min.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap-utilities.rtl.css\n│   ├── bootstrap-utilities.rtl.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap-utilities.rtl.min.css\n│   ├── bootstrap-utilities.rtl.min.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap.css\n│   ├── bootstrap.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap.min.css\n│   ├── bootstrap.min.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap.rtl.css\n│   ├── bootstrap.rtl.css.map\n│   ├── bootstrap.rtl.min.css\n│   └── bootstrap.rtl.min.css.map\n└── js/\n    ├── bootstrap.bundle.js\n    ├── bootstrap.bundle.js.map\n    ├── bootstrap.bundle.min.js\n    ├── bootstrap.bundle.min.js.map\n    ├── bootstrap.esm.js\n    ├── bootstrap.esm.js.map\n    ├── bootstrap.esm.min.js\n    ├── bootstrap.esm.min.js.map\n    ├── bootstrap.js\n    ├── bootstrap.js.map\n    ├── bootstrap.min.js\n    └── bootstrap.min.js.map\n```\n\nWe provide compiled CSS and JS (`bootstrap.*`), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (`bootstrap.min.*`). [source maps](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/source-maps) (`bootstrap.*.map`) are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools. Bundled JS files (`bootstrap.bundle.js` and minified `bootstrap.bundle.min.js`) include [Popper](https://popper.js.org/).\n\n\n## Bugs and feature requests\n\nHave a bug or a feature request? Please first read the [issue guidelines](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-the-issue-tracker) and search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/new).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nBootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://getbootstrap.com/>. The docs may also be run locally.\n\nDocumentation search is powered by [Algolia's DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/). Working on our search? Be sure to set `debug: true` in `site/assets/js/search.js`.\n\n### Running documentation locally\n\n1. Run `npm install` to install the Node.js dependencies, including Hugo (the site builder).\n2. Run `npm run test` (or a specific npm script) to rebuild distributed CSS and JavaScript files, as well as our docs assets.\n3. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `npm run docs-serve` in the command line.\n4. Open `http://localhost:9001/` in your browser, and voilà.\n\nLearn more about using Hugo by reading its [documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).\n\n### Documentation for previous releases\n\nYou can find all our previous releases docs on <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/versions/>.\n\n[Previous releases](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) and their documentation are also available for download.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read through our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). Included are directions for opening issues, coding standards, and notes on development.\n\nMoreover, if your pull request contains JavaScript patches or features, you must include [relevant unit tests](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/main/js/tests). All HTML and CSS should conform to the [Code Guide](https://github.com/mdo/code-guide), maintained by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo).\n\nEditor preferences are available in the [editor config](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/.editorconfig) for easy use in common text editors. Read more and download plugins at <https://editorconfig.org/>.\n\n\n## Community\n\nGet updates on Bootstrap's development and chat with the project maintainers and community members.\n\n- Follow [@getbootstrap on Twitter](https://twitter.com/getbootstrap).\n- Read and subscribe to [The Official Bootstrap Blog](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/).\n- Join [the official Slack room](https://bootstrap-slack.herokuapp.com/).\n- Chat with fellow Bootstrappers in IRC. On the `irc.libera.chat` server, in the `#bootstrap` channel.\n- Implementation help may be found at Stack Overflow (tagged [`bootstrap-5`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bootstrap-5)).\n- Developers should use the keyword `bootstrap` on packages which modify or add to the functionality of Bootstrap when distributing through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/bootstrap) or similar delivery mechanisms for maximum discoverability.\n\n\n## Versioning\n\nFor transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](https://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we adhere to those rules whenever possible.\n\nSee [the Releases section of our GitHub project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) for changelogs for each release version of Bootstrap. Release announcement posts on [the official Bootstrap blog](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/) contain summaries of the most noteworthy changes made in each release.\n\n\n## Creators\n\n**Mark Otto**\n\n- <https://twitter.com/mdo>\n- <https://github.com/mdo>\n\n**Jacob Thornton**\n\n- <https://twitter.com/fat>\n- <https://github.com/fat>\n\n\n## Thanks\n\n<a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/\">\n  <img src=\"https://live.browserstack.com/images/opensource/browserstack-logo.svg\" alt=\"BrowserStack Logo\" width=\"192\" height=\"42\">\n</a>\n\nThanks to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for providing the infrastructure that allows us to test in real browsers!\n\n\n## Sponsors\n\nSupport this project by becoming a sponsor.
