For more details, see [the documentation](https://docs.ember-cli-typescript.com), which includes:\n\n- troubleshooting tips\n- a walkthrough for using TypeScript with Ember effectively\n- guides for publishing addons written in TypeScript\n- more details on how the addon sets up your project during installation\n\n‚Ä¶and much more!\n\n## Usage\n\n### Installation and Setup\n\nYou can simply `ember install` the dependency like normal:\n```sh\nember install ember-cli-typescript@latest\n```\n\nAll dependencies will be added to your `package.json`, and you're ready to roll! **If you're upgrading from a previous release, see below!** you should check to merge any tweaks you've made to `tsconfig.json`.\n\n### Upgrading from 1.x\n\nThere are a number of important changes between ember-cli-typescript v1 and v2, which mean the upgrade process is *straightforward* but *specific*:\n\n1. Update ember-cli-babel. Fix any problems introduced during the upgrade.\n2. Update ember-decorators. Fix any problems introduced during the upgrade.\n3. Update ember-cli-typescript. Follow the detailed upgrade guide below to fix discrepancies between Babel and TypeScript's compiled output.\n\nIf you deviate from this order, you are likely to have a *much* more difficult time upgrading!\n\n#### Update ember-cli-babel\n\nember-cli-typescript **requires** ember-cli-babel at version 7.1.0 or above, which requires ember-cli 2.13 or above. It also **requires** @babel/core 7.2.0 or higher.\n\nThe recommended approach here is to deduplicate existing installations of the dependency, remove and reinstall ember-cli-babel to make sure that all its transitive dependencies are updated to the latest possible, and then to deduplicate *again*.\n\nIf using yarn:\n    \n```\nnpx yarn-deduplicate\nyarn remove ember-cli-babel\nyarn add --dev ember-cli-babel\nnpx yarn-deduplicate\n```\n\nIf using npm:\n      \n```\nnpm dedupe\nnpm uninstall ember-cli-babel\nnpm install --save-dev ember-cli-babel\nnpm dedupe\n```\n\nNote: If you are also using ember-decorators‚Äîand specifically the babel-transform that gets added with it‚Äîyou will need update @ember-decorators/babel-transforms as well (anything over 3.1.0 should work):\n\n```\nember install ember-decorators@^3.1.0 @ember-decorators/babel-transforms@^3.1.0\n```\n\n#### Update ember-decorators\n\nIf you're on a version of Ember before 3.10, follow the same process of deduplication, reinstallation, and re-deduplication as described for ember-cli-babel above for ember-decorators. This will get you the latest version of ember-decorators and, importantly, its @ember-decorators/babel-transforms dependency.\n\n#### Update ember-cli-typescript\n\nNow you can simply `ember install` the dependency like normal:\n\n```sh\nember install ember-cli-typescript@latest\n```\n\n***Note:* To work properly, starting from v2, ember-cli-typescript must be declared as a `dependency`, not a `devDependency` for addons. With `ember install` this migration will be automatically handled for you.**\n\nIf you choose to make the upgrade manually with yarn or npm, here are the steps you need to follow:\n\n1. Remove ember-cli-typescript from your `devDependencies`.\n\n    With yarn:\n\n    ```sh\n    yarn remove ember-cli-typescript\n    ```\n\n    With npm:\n\n    ```sh\n    npm uninstall ember-cli-typescript\n    ```\n\n2. Install the latest of ember-cli-typescript as a `dependency`:\n\n    With yarn:\n\n    ```sh\n    yarn add ember-cli-typescript@latest\n    ```\n\n    With npm:\n\n    ```sh\n    npm install --save ember-cli-typescript@latest\n    ```\n\n3. Run `ember generate`:\n\n    ```sh\n    ember generate ember-cli-typescript\n    ```\n\n##### Account for addon build pipeline changes\n\nSince we now integrate in a more traditional way into Ember CLI's build pipeline, there are two changes required for addons using TypeScript.\n\n- Addons can no longer use `.ts` in `app`, because an addon's `app` directory gets merged with and uses the *host's* (i.e. the other addon or app's) preprocessors, and we cannot guarantee the host has TS support. Note that `.ts` will continue to work for in-repo addons because the app build works with the host's (i.e. the app's, not the addon's) preprocessors.\n\n- Similarly, apps must use `.js` to override addon defaults in `app`, since the different file extension means apps no long consistently \"win\" over addon versions (a limitation of how Babel + app merging interact).\n\n##### Account for TS ‚Üí Babel issues\n\nember-cli-typescript v2 uses Babel to compile your code, and the TypeScript compiler only to *check* your code. This makes for much faster builds, and eliminates the differences between Babel and TypeScript in the build output that could cause problems in v1. However, because of those differences, you‚Äôll need to make a few changes in the process of upgrading.\n\n- `const enum` is not supported at all. You will need to replace all uses of `const enum` with simply `enum` or constants.\n\n- Using ES5 getters or settings with `this` type annotations is not supported through at least Babel 7.3. However, they should also be unnecessary with ES6 classes, so you can simply *remove* the `this` type annotation.\n\n- Trailing commas after rest function parameters (`function foo(...bar[],) {}`) are disallowed by the ECMAScript spec, so Babel also disallows them.\n\n- Re-exports of types have to be disambiguated to be *types*, rather than values. Neither of these will work:\n\n  ```ts\n  export { FooType } from 'foo';\n  ```\n  ```ts\n  import { FooType } from 'foo';\n  export { FooType };\n  ```\n\n  In both cases, Babel attempts to emit a *value* export, not just a *type* export, and fails because there is no actual value to emit. You can do this instead as a workaround:\n\n  ```ts\n  import * as Foo from 'foo';\n  export type FooType = Foo.FooType;\n  ```\n\n## Getting Help\n\nWhen seeking help, you should first consider what you need, and which aspect of the Ember+TypeScript ecosystem your issue pertains to.\n\n### üí¨ Getting Started\n\nWe have a channel (**`#e-typescript`**) on the [Ember Community Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS) where you can ask about getting started, good resources for self-directed learning and more.\n\n### üìö Issues With Ember Type Definitions\n\nIf you've found that some of the Ember type information is missing things, or is incorrect in some way, please first ensure you're using the latest version of the [packages this addon installs](https://docs.ember-cli-typescript.com/installation#other-packages-this-addon-installs). Although [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ember.js+typescript) and [Discuss](https://discuss.emberjs.com/search?q=typescript) are not the advised places to report problems, you may find an answer there.\n\nIf you don't find an answer, please [open an enhancement request or bug report in this project](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript/issues/new/choose).\n\n### ‚öôÔ∏è Issues With Adding TypeScript Support To Apps and Addons\n\nIf you run into a problem with the way TypeScript is compiled in Ember apps (i.e., a broccoli error message, incorrect build output, etc...), please first check [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ember.js+typescript) and [Discuss](https://discuss.emberjs.com/search?q=typescript), as you may find an answer.\n\nIf you don't find an answer, please [open an enhancement request or bug report in this project](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript/issues/new/choose).\n\n### ‚úÖ Issues With Linting TypeScript\n\nThe TypeScript compiler does some very basic linting of your code, but most developers use (and Microsoft now officially recommends) ESLint.\n\nOne sure way to tell which tool is generating an error message is that _Linters like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) or [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/) will always mention their name, and the name of the pertinent rule, when it alerts you to a violation_.\n\nFor example, in VS Code, you might see a popover with this message:\n\n```plain\n[eslint] variable name must be in lowerCamelCase, PascalCase or UPPER_CASE (variable-name)\n```\n\nHere, `variable-name` is the name of the rule, and `[eslint]` is the *source* of the rule.\n\n- For issues relating to typescript compiler analysis, [create an issue in this project](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript/issues/new/choose).\n- If you run into issues with using ESLint with Ember, create an issue [here](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-eslint/issues/new).\n- For TSLint-related concerns, please create an issue in the [`ember-cli-tslint`](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-tslint) project by clicking [here](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-tslint/issues/new).\n\n## Supported Ember and TypeScript versions\n\nember-cli-typescript runs its test suite against Ember CLI current and beta. It's also in active use in several large applications. Any breakage for upcoming releases _should_ be detected and fixed ahead of those releases, but you can help us guarantee that by running your own Ember.js+TypeScript app with beta and canary turned on and let us know if you run into issues with upcoming Ember.js releases.\n\nThis library supports the current version of TypeScript [![TS Version](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/Microsoft/typescript.svg?label=latest%20typescript%20release)](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/releases/latest) and at least one previous minor or major release. In other words, if `3.4` is the latest release, we **do** support `3.4.x`, `3.3.x`, and **might** support `3.2.x` as well. (The test suite only runs against the current release and `next` branch, but the TS versions do not affect the build process in the same way they do type definitions.)\n\n## Installing from git\n\nThis addon uses TypeScript for its own implementation, so if you install `ember-cli-typescript` from git rather than from the npm registry, you won't get compiled `.js` files. To get everything working, you can install `ts-node` as a project dependency, and `ember-cli-typescript` will ensure it's registered correctly to transpile source files as needed."},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","count":57574},{"from":"2021-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","count":409154},{"from":"2021-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","count":1758367},{"from":"2021-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","count":5075545},{"from":"2021-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","count":10625524},{"from":"2020-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","count":17036765}],"dependentsCount":182,"starsCount":2},"github":{"homepage":"https://docs.ember-cli-typescript.com","starsCount":349,"forksCount":83,"subscribersCount":28,"issues":{"count":1439,"openCount":100,"distribution":{"3600":287,"10800":284,"32400":100,"97200":124,"291600":73,"874800":155,"2624400":123,"7873200":115,"23619600":80,"70858800":63,"212576400":35},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"scottkidder","commitsCount":1},{"username":"tansongyang","commitsCount":14},{"username":"luketheobscure","commitsCount":2},{"username":"happycollision","commitsCount":3},{"username":"ember-tomster","commitsCount":1},{"username":"buschtoens","commitsCount":2},{"username":"alexlafroscia","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mfeckie","commitsCount":5},{"username":"dwickern","commitsCount":14},{"username":"allenylzhou","commitsCount":2},{"username":"csantero","commitsCount":6},{"username":"sivakumar-kailasam","commitsCount":1},{"username":"locks","commitsCount":7},{"username":"dustinsoftware","commitsCount":2},{"username":"0xadada","commitsCount":1},{"username":"chriskrycho","commitsCount":413},{"username":"inkless","commitsCount":1},{"username":"gitKrystan","commitsCount":1},{"username":"BryanCrotaz","commitsCount":3},{"username":"hjdivad","commitsCount":1},{"username":"winding-lines","commitsCount":1},{"username":"martletandco","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ibraheem4","commitsCount":1},{"username":"dustinfarris","commitsCount":2},{"username":"jrr","commitsCount":1},{"username":"acorncom","commitsCount":1},{"username":"simonihmig","commitsCount":5},{"username":"dfreeman","commitsCount":193},{"username":"quantuminformation","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mrloop","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ddoria921","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jacobq","commitsCount":1},{"username":"vitch","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mydea","commitsCount":1},{"username":"MrChocolatine","commitsCount":5},{"username":"mike-north","commitsCount":117},{"username":"josemarluedke","commitsCount":1},{"username":"renovate-bot","commitsCount":707},{"username":"Bouke","commitsCount":3},{"username":"toranb","commitsCount":1},{"username":"gabrielgrant","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jamescdavis","commitsCount":67},{"username":"theroncross","commitsCount":2},{"username":"ro0gr","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ryanlabouve","commitsCount":1}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","count":10},{"from":"2021-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","count":22},{"from":"2020-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","count":212}],"statuses":[{"context":"GitBook","state":"success"}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":11581,"testsSize":46036,"hasNpmIgnore":true,"hasChangelog":true},"linters":["editorconfig","eslint","prettier"],"outdatedDependencies":{"ansi-to-html":{"required":"^0.6.15","stable":"0.7.1","latest":"0.7.1"},"execa":{"required":"^4.0.0","stable":"5.1.1","latest":"5.1.1"},"walk-sync":{"required":"^2.2.0","stable":"3.0.0","latest":"3.0.0"},"fs-extra":{"required":"^9.0.1","stable":"10.0.0","latest":"10.0.0"}}}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.9999999999999999,"tests":0.85,"health":0.5,"branding":0},"popularity":{"communityInterest":507,"downloadsCount":1691848.3333333333,"downloadsAcceleration":6072.696308980212,"dependentsCount":182},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":0.7704623287671233,"commitsFrequency":0.9026986301369864,"openIssues":1,"issuesDistribution":0.4614594424636392}},"score":{"final":0.7230486978637807,"detail":{"quality":0.8196657602286634,"popularity":0.3828819848748219,"maintenance":0.9804007859685543}}}
