It has the benefit that it takes into account variations in some environments, e.g., [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/4690).\n\n### Complex Example\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst yargs = require('yargs/yargs')\nconst { hideBin } = require('yargs/helpers')\n\nyargs(hideBin(process.argv))\n  .command('serve [port]', 'start the server', (yargs) => {\n    return yargs\n      .positional('port', {\n        describe: 'port to bind on',\n        default: 5000\n      })\n  }, (argv) => {\n    if (argv.verbose) console.info(`start server on :${argv.port}`)\n    serve(argv.port)\n  })\n  .option('verbose', {\n    alias: 'v',\n    type: 'boolean',\n    description: 'Run with verbose logging'\n  })\n  .argv\n```\n\nRun the example above with `--help` to see the help for the application.\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\n### TypeScript\n\nyargs has type definitions at [@types/yargs][type-definitions].\n\n```\nnpm i @types/yargs --save-dev\n```\n\nSee usage examples in [docs](/docs/typescript.md).\n\n### Deno\n\nAs of `v16`, `yargs` supports [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno):\n\n```typescript\nimport yargs from 'https://deno.land/x/yargs/deno.ts'\nimport { Arguments } from 'https://deno.land/x/yargs/deno-types.ts'\n\nyargs(Deno.args)\n  .command('download <files...>', 'download a list of files', (yargs: any) => {\n    return yargs.positional('files', {\n      describe: 'a list of files to do something with'\n    })\n  }, (argv: Arguments) => {\n    console.info(argv)\n  })\n  .strictCommands()\n  .demandCommand(1)\n  .argv\n```\n\n### ESM\n\nAs of `v16`,`yargs` supports ESM imports:\n\n```js\nimport yargs from 'yargs'\nimport { hideBin } from 'yargs/helpers'\n\nyargs(hideBin(process.argv))\n  .command('curl <url>', 'fetch the contents of the URL', () => {}, (argv) => {\n    console.info(argv)\n  })\n  .demandCommand(1)\n  .argv\n```\n\n### Usage in Browser\n\nSee examples of using yargs in the browser in [docs](/docs/browser.md).\n\n## Community\n\nHaving problems? want to contribute? join our [community slack](http://devtoolscommunity.herokuapp.com).\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n* [Yargs' API](/docs/api.md)\n* [Examples](/docs/examples.md)\n* [Parsing Tricks](/docs/tricks.md)\n  * [Stop the Parser](/docs/tricks.md#stop)\n  * [Negating Boolean Arguments](/docs/tricks.md#negate)\n  * [Numbers](/docs/tricks.md#numbers)\n  * [Arrays](/docs/tricks.md#arrays)\n  * [Objects](/docs/tricks.md#objects)\n  * [Quotes](/docs/tricks.md#quotes)\n* [Advanced Topics](/docs/advanced.md)\n  * [Composing Your App Using Commands](/docs/advanced.md#commands)\n  * [Building Configurable CLI Apps](/docs/advanced.md#configuration)\n  * [Customizing Yargs' Parser](/docs/advanced.md#customizing)\n  * [Bundling yargs](/docs/bundling.md)\n* [Contributing](/contributing.md)\n\n## Supported Node.js Versions\n\nLibraries in this ecosystem make a best effort to track\n[Node.js' release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
