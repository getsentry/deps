This is an [upstream issue with React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet/issues/315); however, it can be worked around by passing the `defer={false}` prop into your `Helmet` component. For example:\n\n```jsx\n<Helmet title=\"foo bar\" defer={false} />\n```\n\n## Compatibility with React 16.8 useEffect hook\n\nIf you are using this plugin with React hooks, you may notice some errors like `maximum call stack size exceeded`. To ensure everything is running smoothly when using these technologies together, make sure to validate the following:\n\n- You have updated to the latest version of `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`\n- You are using version 6.0.0-beta or later of `react-helmet`\n- You are importing React Helmet using `import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet'` rather than the old `import Helmet from 'react-helmet'`\n\n##
