Although originally designed for use with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and installable via `npm i async`, it can also be used directly in the browser.  A ESM/MJS version is included in the main `async` package that should automatically be used with compatible bundlers such as Webpack and Rollup.\n\nA pure ESM version of Async is available as [`async-es`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-es).\n\nFor Documentation, visit <https://caolan.github.io/async/>\n\n*For Async v1.5.x documentation, go
