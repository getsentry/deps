This ensures that the selectors are also stripped correctly\neven if the app that uses the addon does not use ember-test-selectors itself.\n\n\nConfiguration\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can override when the `data-test-*` attributes should be stripped from the\nbuild by modifying your `ember-cli-build.js` file:\n\n```js\nvar app = new EmberApp({\n  'ember-test-selectors': {\n    strip: false\n  }\n});\n```\n\n`strip` accepts a `Boolean` value and defaults to `!app.tests`, which means\nthat the attributes will be stripped for production builds, unless the build\nwas triggered by `ember test`. That means that if you use\n`ember test --environment=production` the test selectors will still work, but\nfor `ember build -prod` they will be stripped out.\n\nLicense\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nember-test-selectors is developed by and &copy;\n[simplabs GmbH](http://simplabs.com) and contributors.
