This means it\nis stable; the code surface will not change in backwards-incompatible ways\nunless absolutely necessary (e.g. because of critical security issues) or with\nan extensive deprecation period. Issues and requests against **GA** libraries\nare addressed with the highest priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Information: [Google Cloud Platform Launch Stages][launch_stages]\n\n[launch_stages]: https://cloud.google.com/terms/launch-stages\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!
