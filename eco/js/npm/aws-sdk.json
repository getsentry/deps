Prior to v2.4.8, release notes can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/?tag=releasenotes%23keywords%23javascript\n\n## Table of Contents:\n* [Getting Started](#getting-Started)\n* [Getting Help](#getting-help)\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n## How To Install\n\n### In the Browser\n\nTo use the SDK in the browser, simply add the following script tag to your\nHTML pages:\n\n    <script src=\"https://sdk.amazonaws.com/js/aws-sdk-2.980.0.min.js\"></script>\n\nYou can also build a custom browser SDK with your specified set of AWS services.\nThis can allow you to reduce the SDK's size, specify different API versions of\nservices, or use AWS services that don't currently support CORS if you are\nworking in an environment that does not enforce CORS. To get started:\n\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/building-sdk-for-browsers.html\n\nThe AWS SDK is also compatible with [browserify](http://browserify.org).\n\nFor browser-based web, mobile and hybrid apps, you can use [AWS Amplify Library](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/?utm_source=aws-js-sdk&utm_campaign=browser) which extends the AWS SDK and provides an easier and declarative interface.\n\n### In Node.js\n\nThe preferred way to install the AWS SDK for Node.js is to use the\n[npm](http://npmjs.org) package manager for Node.js. Simply type the following\ninto a terminal window:\n\n```sh\nnpm install aws-sdk\n```\n\n### In React Native\nTo use the SDK in a react native project, first install the SDK using npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install aws-sdk\n```\n\nThen within your application, you can reference the react native compatible version of the SDK with the following:\n\n```javascript\nvar AWS = require('aws-sdk/dist/aws-sdk-react-native');\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use [AWS Amplify Library](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/react_native_guide?utm_source=aws-js-sdk&utm_campaign=react-native) which extends AWS SDK and provides React Native UI components and CLI support to work with AWS services.\n\n### Using Bower\n\nYou can also use [Bower](http://bower.io) to install the SDK by typing the\nfollowing into a terminal window:\n\n```sh\nbower install aws-sdk-js\n```\n\n## Usage with TypeScript\nThe AWS SDK for JavaScript bundles TypeScript definition files for use in TypeScript projects and to support tools that can read `.d.ts` files.\nOur goal is to keep these TypeScript definition files updated with each release for any public api.\n\n### Pre-requisites\nBefore you can begin using these TypeScript definitions with your project, you need to make sure your project meets a few of these requirements:\n\n * Use TypeScript v2.x\n * Includes the TypeScript definitions for node. You can use npm to install this by typing the following into a terminal window:\n\n    ```sh\n    npm install --save-dev @types/node\n    ```\n\n * If you are targeting at es5 or older ECMA standards, your `tsconfig.json` has to include `'es5'` and `'es2015.promise'` under `compilerOptions.lib`.\n See [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/ts/tsconfig.json) for an example.\n\n### In the Browser\nTo use the TypeScript definition files with the global `AWS` object in a front-end project, add the following line to the top of your JavaScript file:\n\n```javascript\n/// <reference types=\"aws-sdk\" />\n```\n\nThis will provide support for the global `AWS` object.\n\n### In Node.js\nTo use the TypeScript definition files within a Node.js project, simply import `aws-sdk` as you normally would.\n\nIn a TypeScript file:\n\n```javascript\n// import entire SDK\nimport AWS from 'aws-sdk';\n// import AWS object without services\nimport AWS from 'aws-sdk/global';\n// import individual service\nimport S3 from 'aws-sdk/clients/s3';\n```\n\n**NOTE:** You need to add `\"esModuleInterop\": true` to compilerOptions of your `tsconfig.json`. If not possible, use like `import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk'`.\n\nIn a JavaScript file:\n\n```javascript\n// import entire SDK\nvar AWS = require('aws-sdk');\n// import AWS object without services\nvar AWS = require('aws-sdk/global');\n// import individual service\nvar S3 = require('aws-sdk/clients/s3');\n```\n\n### With React\n\nTo create React applications with AWS SDK, you can use [AWS Amplify Library](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/react_guide?utm_source=aws-js-sdk&utm_campaign=react) which provides React components and CLI support to work with AWS services.\n\n### With Angular\nDue to the SDK's reliance on node.js typings, you may encounter compilation \n[issues](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/1271) when using the\ntypings provided by the SDK in an Angular project created using the Angular CLI.\n\nTo resolve these issues, either add `\"types\": [\"node\"]` to the project's `tsconfig.app.json`\nfile, or remove the `\"types\"` field entirely.\n\n[AWS Amplify Library](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/angular_guide?utm_source=aws-js-sdk&utm_campaign=angular) provides Angular components and CLI support to work with AWS services.\n\n### Known Limitations\nThere are a few known limitations with the bundled TypeScript definitions at this time:\n\n * Service client typings reflect the latest `apiVersion`, regardless of which `apiVersion` is specified when creating a client.\n * Service-bound parameters use the `any` type.\n\n# Getting Help\n\nThe best way to interact with our team is through GitHub. \nYou can [open an issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/new/choose) and choose from one of our templates for \n[bug reports](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C+needs-triage&template=---bug-report.md&title=), \n[feature requests](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&template=---feature-request.md&title=) \nor [guidance](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=guidance%2C+needs-triage&template=---questions---help.md&title=). \nYou may also find help on community resources such as [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-sdk-js) with the tag #aws-sdk-js.\nIf you have a support plan with [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/), you can also create a new support case.\n\nPlease make sure to check out our resources too before opening an issue:\n* Our [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html) and [API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/)\n* Our [Changelog](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for recent changes.\n* Our [code examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/sdk-code-samples.html).\n\nPlease see [SERVICES.md](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/SERVICES.md) for a list of supported services.\n\n# Maintenance and support for SDK major versions\nFor information about maintenance and support for SDK major versions and their underlying dependencies, see the following in the [AWS SDKs and Tools Shared Configuration and Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/overview.html):\n* [AWS SDKs and Tools Maintenance Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/maint-policy.html)\n* [AWS SDKs and Tools Version Support Matrix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/version-support-matrix.html)\n\n\n\n# Contributing\nWe welcome community contributions and pull requests.
