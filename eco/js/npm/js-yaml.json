Started as [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/) port, it was\ncompletely rewritten from scratch. Now it's very fast, and supports 1.2 spec.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n### YAML module for node.js\n\n```\nnpm install js-yaml\n```\n\n\n### CLI executable\n\nIf you want to inspect your YAML files from CLI, install js-yaml globally:\n\n```\nnpm install -g js-yaml\n```\n\n#### Usage\n\n```\nusage: js-yaml [-h] [-v] [-c] [-t] file\n\nPositional arguments:\n  file           File with YAML document(s)\n\nOptional arguments:\n  -h, --help     Show this help message and exit.\n  -v, --version  Show program's version number and exit.\n  -c, --compact  Display errors in compact mode\n  -t, --trace    Show stack trace on error\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\nHere we cover the most 'useful' methods. If you need advanced details (creating\nyour own tags), see [examples](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/tree/master/examples)\nfor more info.\n\n``` javascript\nconst yaml = require('js-yaml');\nconst fs   = require('fs');\n\n// Get document, or throw exception on error\ntry {\n  const doc = yaml.load(fs.readFileSync('/home/ixti/example.yml', 'utf8'));\n  console.log(doc);\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log(e);\n}\n```\n\n\n### load (string [ , options ])\n\nParses `string` as single YAML document. Returns either a\nplain object, a string, a number, `null` or `undefined`, or throws `YAMLException` on error. By default, does\nnot support regexps, functions and undefined.\n\noptions:\n\n- `filename` _(default: null)_ - string to be used as a file path in\n  error/warning messages.\n- `onWarning` _(default: null)_ - function to call on warning messages.\n  Loader will call this function with an instance of `YAMLException` for each warning.\n- `schema` _(default: `DEFAULT_SCHEMA`)_ - specifies a schema to use.\n  - `FAILSAFE_SCHEMA` - only strings, arrays and plain objects:\n    http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2802346\n  - `JSON_SCHEMA` - all JSON-supported types:\n    http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2803231\n  - `CORE_SCHEMA` - same as `JSON_SCHEMA`:\n    http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2804923\n  - `DEFAULT_SCHEMA` - all supported YAML types.\n- `json` _(default: false)_ - compatibility with JSON.parse behaviour. If true, then duplicate keys in a mapping will override values rather than throwing an error.\n\nNOTE: This function **does not** understand multi-document sources, it throws\nexception on those.\n\nNOTE: JS-YAML **does not** support schema-specific tag resolution restrictions.\nSo, the JSON schema is not as strictly defined in the YAML specification.\nIt allows numbers in any notation, use `Null` and `NULL` as `null`, etc.\nThe core schema also has no such restrictions. It allows binary notation for integers.\n\n\n### loadAll (string [, iterator] [, options ])\n\nSame as `load()`, but understands multi-document sources. Applies\n`iterator` to each document if specified, or returns array of documents.\n\n``` javascript\nconst yaml = require('js-yaml');\n\nyaml.loadAll(data, function (doc) {\n  console.log(doc);\n});\n```\n\n\n### dump (object [ , options ])\n\nSerializes `object` as a YAML document. Uses `DEFAULT_SCHEMA`, so it will\nthrow an exception if you try to dump regexps or functions. However, you can\ndisable exceptions by setting the `skipInvalid` option to `true`.\n\noptions:\n\n- `indent` _(default: 2)_ - indentation width to use (in spaces).\n- `noArrayIndent` _(default: false)_ - when true, will not add an indentation level to array elements\n- `skipInvalid` _(default: false)_ - do not throw on invalid types (like function\n  in the safe schema) and skip pairs and single values with such types.\n- `flowLevel` _(default: -1)_ - specifies level of nesting, when to switch from\n  block to flow style for collections. -1 means block style everwhere\n- `styles` - \"tag\" => \"style\" map. Each tag may have own set of styles.\n- `schema` _(default: `DEFAULT_SCHEMA`)_ specifies a schema to use.\n- `sortKeys` _(default: `false`)_ - if `true`, sort keys when dumping YAML. If a\n  function, use the function to sort the keys.\n- `lineWidth` _(default: `80`)_ - set max line width. Set `-1` for unlimited width.\n- `noRefs` _(default: `false`)_ - if `true`, don't convert duplicate objects into references\n- `noCompatMode` _(default: `false`)_ - if `true` don't try to be compatible with older\n  yaml versions. Currently: don't quote \"yes\", \"no\" and so on, as required for YAML 1.1\n- `condenseFlow` _(default: `false`)_ - if `true` flow sequences will be condensed, omitting the space between `a, b`. Eg. `'[a,b]'`, and omitting the space between `key: value` and quoting the key. Eg. `'{\"a\":b}'` Can be useful when using yaml for pretty URL query params as spaces are %-encoded.\n- `quotingType` _(`'` or `\"`, default: `'`)_ - strings will be quoted using this quoting style. If you specify single quotes, double quotes will still be used for non-printable characters.\n- `forceQuotes` _(default: `false`)_ - if `true`, all non-key strings will be quoted even if they normally don't need to.\n- `replacer` - callback `function (key, value)` called recursively on each key/value in source object (see `replacer` docs for `JSON.stringify`).\n\nThe following table show availlable styles (e.g. \"canonical\",\n\"binary\"...) available for each tag (.e.g. !!null, !!int ...). Yaml\noutput is shown on the right side after `=>` (default setting) or `->`:\n\n``` none\n!!null\n  \"canonical\"   -> \"~\"\n  \"lowercase\"   => \"null\"\n  \"uppercase\"   -> \"NULL\"\n  \"camelcase\"   -> \"Null\"\n\n!!int\n  \"binary\"      -> \"0b1\", \"0b101010\", \"0b1110001111010\"\n  \"octal\"       -> \"0o1\", \"0o52\", \"0o16172\"\n  \"decimal\"     => \"1\", \"42\", \"7290\"\n  \"hexadecimal\" -> \"0x1\", \"0x2A\", \"0x1C7A\"\n\n!!bool\n  \"lowercase\"   => \"true\", \"false\"\n  \"uppercase\"   -> \"TRUE\", \"FALSE\"\n  \"camelcase\"   -> \"True\", \"False\"\n\n!!float\n  \"lowercase\"   => \".nan\", '.inf'\n  \"uppercase\"   -> \".NAN\", '.INF'\n  \"camelcase\"   -> \".NaN\", '.Inf'\n```\n\nExample:\n\n``` javascript\ndump(object, {\n  'styles': {\n    '!!null': 'canonical' // dump null as ~\n  },\n  'sortKeys': true        // sort object keys\n});\n```\n\nSupported YAML types\n--------------------\n\nThe list of standard YAML tags and corresponding JavaScript types. See also\n[YAML tag discussion](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/YAMLTagDiscussion) and\n[YAML types repository](http://yaml.org/type/).\n\n```\n!!null ''                   # null\n!!bool 'yes'                # bool\n!!int '3...'                # number\n!!float '3.14...'           # number\n!!binary '...base64...'     # buffer\n!!timestamp 'YYYY-...'      # date\n!!omap [ ... ]              # array of key-value pairs\n!!pairs [ ... ]             # array or array pairs\n!!set { ... }               # array of objects with given keys and null values\n!!str '...'                 # string\n!!seq [ ... ]               # array\n!!map { ... }               # object\n```\n\n**JavaScript-specific tags**\n\nSee [js-yaml-js-types](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml-js-types) for\nextra types.\n\n\nCaveats\n-------\n\nNote, that you use arrays or objects as key in JS-YAML. JS does not allow objects\nor arrays as keys, and stringifies (by calling `toString()` method) them at the\nmoment of adding them.\n\n``` yaml\n---\n? [ foo, bar ]\n: - baz\n? { foo: bar }\n: - baz\n  - baz\n```\n\n``` javascript\n{ \"foo,bar\": [\"baz\"], \"[object Object]\": [\"baz\", \"baz\"] }\n```\n\nAlso, reading of properties on implicit block mapping keys is not supported yet.\nSo, the following YAML document cannot be loaded.\n\n``` yaml\n&anchor foo:\n  foo: bar\n  *anchor: duplicate key\n  baz: bat\n  *anchor: duplicate key\n```\n\n\njs-yaml for enterprise\n----------------------\n\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription\n\nThe maintainers of js-yaml and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications.
