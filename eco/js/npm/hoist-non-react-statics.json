Versions prior to 3.x will not support ForwardRefs.\n\n| hoist-non-react-statics Version | Compatible React Version |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 3.x | 0.13-16.x With ForwardRef Support |\n| 2.x | 0.13-16.x Without ForwardRef Support |\n| 1.x | 0.13-16.2 |\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThis package uses `Object.defineProperty` which has a broken implementation in IE8.
