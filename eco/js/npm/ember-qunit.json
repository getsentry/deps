If you have issues\nwith this then `ember install ember-cli-qunit`, which should work exactly\nthe same.\n\nUpgrading\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor instructions how to upgrade to the latest version, please read our\n[Migration Guide](docs/migration.md).\n\nUsage\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following section describes the use of ember-qunit with the latest modern\nEmber testing APIs, as laid out in the RFCs\n[232](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0232-simplify-qunit-testing-api.md)\nand\n[268](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0268-acceptance-testing-refactor.md).\n\nFor the older APIs have a look at our [Legacy Guide](docs/legacy.md).\n\n### Setting the Application\n\nYour `tests/test-helper.js` file should look similar to the following, to\ncorrectly setup the application required by `@ember/test-helpers`:\n\n```javascript\nimport Application from '../app';\nimport config from '../config/environment';\nimport { setApplication } from '@ember/test-helpers';\nimport { start } from 'ember-qunit';\n\nsetApplication(Application.create(config.APP));\n\nstart();\n```\n\nAlso make sure that you have set `ENV.APP.autoboot = false;` for the `test`\nenvironment in your `config/environment.js`.\n\n### Setup Tests\n\nThe `setupTest()` function can be used to setup a unit test for any kind\nof \"module/unit\" of your application that can be looked up in a container.\n\nIt will setup your test context with:\n\n* `this.owner` to interact with Ember's [Dependency Injection](https://guides.emberjs.com/v3.0.0/applications/dependency-injection/)\n  system\n* `this.set()`, `this.setProperties()`, `this.get()`, and `this.getProperties()`\n* `this.pauseTest()` method to allow easy pausing/resuming of tests\n\nFor example, the following is a unit test for the `SidebarController`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { module, test } from 'qunit';\nimport { setupTest } from 'ember-qunit';\n\nmodule('SidebarController', function(hooks) {\n  setupTest(hooks);\n\n  // Replace this with your real tests.\n  test('exists', function() {\n    let controller = this.owner.lookup('controller:sidebar');\n    assert.ok(controller);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n\n### Setup Rendering Tests\n\nThe `setupRenderingTest()` function is specifically designed for tests that\nrender arbitrary templates, including components and helpers.\n\nIt will setup your test context the same way as `setupTest()`, and additionally:\n\n* Initializes Ember's renderer to be used with the\n  [Rendering helpers](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/blob/master/API.md#rendering-helpers),\n  specifically `render()`\n* Adds `this.element` to your test context which returns the DOM element\n  representing the wrapper around the elements that were rendered via\n  `render()`\n* sets up the [DOM Interaction Helpers](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/blob/master/API.md#dom-interaction-helpers)\n  from `@ember/test-helpers` (`click()`, `fillIn()`, ...)\n\n```javascript\nimport { module, test } from 'qunit';\nimport { setupRenderingTest } from 'ember-qunit';\nimport { render } from '@ember/test-helpers';\nimport hbs from 'htmlbars-inline-precompile';\n\nmodule('GravatarImageComponent', function(hooks) {\n  setupRenderingTest(hooks);\n\n  test('renders', async function() {\n    await render(hbs`{{gravatar-image}}`);\n    assert.ok(this.element.querySelector('img'));\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### Setup Application Tests\n\nThe `setupApplicationTest()` function can be used to run tests that interact\nwith the whole application, so in most cases acceptance tests.\n\nOn top of `setupTest()` it will:\n\n* Boot your application instance\n* Set up all the [DOM Interaction Helpers](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/blob/master/API.md#dom-interaction-helpers)\n  (`click()`, `fillIn()`, ...) as well as the [Routing Helpers](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/blob/master/API.md#routing-helpers)\n  (`visit()`, `currentURL()`, ...) from `@ember/test-helpers`\n\n```javascript\nimport { module, test } from 'qunit';\nimport { setupApplicationTest } from 'ember-qunit';\nimport { visit, currentURL } from '@ember/test-helpers';\n\nmodule('basic acceptance test', function(hooks) {\n  setupApplicationTest(hooks);\n\n  test('can visit /', async function(assert) {\n    await visit('/');\n    assert.equal(currentURL(), '/');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n\nContributing\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Installation\n\n* `git clone <repository-url>`\n* `cd ember-qunit`\n* `npm install`\n\n### Running tests\n\n* `npm test` (Runs `ember try:each` to test your addon against multiple Ember versions)\n* `ember test`\n* `ember test --server`\n\n### Running the dummy application\n\n* `ember serve`\n* Visit the dummy application at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).\n\nFor more information on using ember-cli, visit
