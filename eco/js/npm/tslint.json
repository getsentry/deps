If you're interested in helping with the TSLint/ESLint migration, please check out our [OSS Fellowship](https://medium.com/palantir/fellowships-for-open-source-developers-3892e6b75ee1) program.\n\nTSLint is an extensible static analysis tool that checks [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors. It is widely supported across modern editors & build systems and can be customized with your own lint rules, configurations, and formatters.\n\nTSLint currently supports:\n\n-   an extensive set of core rules\n-   custom lint rules\n-   custom formatters (failure reporters)\n-   inline disabling and enabling of rules with comment flags in source code\n-   configuration presets (`tslint:latest`, `tslint-react`, etc.) and plugin composition\n-   automatic fixing of formatting & style violations\n-   integration with [MSBuild](https://github.com/joshuakgoldberg/tslint.msbuild), [Grunt](https://github.com/palantir/grunt-tslint), [Gulp](https://github.com/panuhorsmalahti/gulp-tslint), [Atom](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-tslint), [Eclipse](https://github.com/palantir/eclipse-tslint), [Emacs](https://www.flycheck.org/), [Sublime](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-tslint), [Vim](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic), [Visual Studio 2015](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.WebAnalyzer), [Visual Studio 2017](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RichNewman.TypeScriptAnalyzer), [Visual Studio code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) (alternative: use [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) for TS <3.2), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/help/tslint.html) and [more](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/third-party-tools/)\n\n## Installation & Usage\n\nPlease refer to the full installation & usage documentation on the [TSLint website](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/). There, you'll find information about\n\n-   [configuration](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/configuration/),\n-   [core rules](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/),\n-   [core formatters](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/formatters/), and\n-   [customization of TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/develop/custom-rules/).\n-   [inline disabling and enabling of rules with comment flags](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/)\n\n## TSLint Playground\n\nThere is a sandbox environment for TSLint at [palantir.github.io/tslint-playground](https://palantir.github.io/tslint-playground/), which can be used to test rules and see how TSLint works. Issues can be filed against `tslint-playground` [here](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-playground).\n\n## Custom Rules & Plugins\n\n#### Custom rule sets from Palantir\n\n-   [tslint-react](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-react) - Lint rules related to React & JSX.\n-   [tslint-blueprint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-blueprint) - Lint rules to enforce best practices with [blueprintjs libraries](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint)\n\n#### Custom rule sets from the community\n\nIf we don't have all the rules you're looking for, you can either write your own [custom rules](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/develop/custom-rules/) or use rules implementations developed by the community. The repos below are a good source of custom rules:\n\n-   [ESLint rules for TSLint](https://github.com/buzinas/tslint-eslint-rules) - Improve your TSLint with the missing ESLint Rules\n-   [tslint-microsoft-contrib](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib) - A set of TSLint rules used on some Microsoft projects\n-   [codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer) - A set of tslint rules for static code analysis of Angular TypeScript projects\n-   [vrsource-tslint-rules](https://github.com/vrsource/vrsource-tslint-rules)\n-   [tslint-immutable](https://github.com/jonaskello/tslint-immutable) - TSLint rules to disable mutation in TypeScript\n-   [tslint-consistent-codestyle](https://github.com/ajafff/tslint-consistent-codestyle) - TSLint rules to enforce consistent code style in TypeScript\n-   [tslint-sonarts](https://github.com/SonarSource/SonarTS) - Bug-finding rules based on advanced code models to spot hard to find errors in TypeScript\n-   [tslint-clean-code](https://github.com/Glavin001/tslint-clean-code) - A set of TSLint rules inspired by the Clean Code handbook\n-   [rxjs-tslint-rules](https://github.com/cartant/rxjs-tslint-rules) - TSLint rules for RxJS\n\n## Development\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n-   `node` v7+\n-   `yarn` v1.0+\n\n#### Quick Start\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:palantir/tslint.git --config core.autocrlf=input --config core.eol=lf\nyarn\nyarn compile\nyarn
