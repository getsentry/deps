Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/config) methodology.\n\n[![BuildStatus](https://img.shields.io/travis/motdotla/dotenv/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/motdotla/dotenv)\n[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/motdotla/dotenv?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/motdotla/dotenv/branch/master)\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dotenv.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)\n[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/feross/standard)\n[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/motdotla/dotenv/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://coveralls.io/github/motdotla/dotenv?branch=coverall-intergration)\n[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/github/license/motdotla/dotenv.svg)](LICENSE)\n[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-yellow.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org)\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n# with npm\nnpm install dotenv\n\n# or with Yarn\nyarn add dotenv\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAs early as possible in your application, require and configure dotenv.\n\n```javascript\nrequire('dotenv').config()\n```\n\nCreate a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Add\nenvironment-specific variables on new lines in the form of `NAME=VALUE`.\nFor example:\n\n```dosini\nDB_HOST=localhost\nDB_USER=root\nDB_PASS=s1mpl3\n```\n\n`process.env` now has the keys and values you defined in your `.env` file.\n\n```javascript\nconst db = require('db')\ndb.connect({\n  host: process.env.DB_HOST,\n  username: process.env.DB_USER,\n  password: process.env.DB_PASS\n})\n```\n\n### Preload\n\nYou can use the `--require` (`-r`) [command line option](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_r_require_module) to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code. This is the preferred approach when using `import` instead of `require`.\n\n```bash\n$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js\n```\n\nThe configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format `dotenv_config_<option>=value`\n\n```bash\n$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.\n\n```bash\n$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js\n```\n\n```bash\n$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env\n```\n\n## Config\n\n`config` will read your `.env` file, parse the contents, assign it to\n[`process.env`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_process_env),\nand return an Object with a `parsed` key containing the loaded content or an `error` key if it failed.\n\n```js\nconst result = dotenv.config()\n\nif (result.error) {\n  throw result.error\n}\n\nconsole.log(result.parsed)\n```\n\nYou can additionally, pass options to `config`.\n\n### Options\n\n#### Path\n\nDefault: `path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')`\n\nYou may specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.\n\n```js\nrequire('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })\n```\n\n#### Encoding\n\nDefault: `utf8`\n\nYou may specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.\n\n```js\nrequire('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })\n```\n\n#### Debug\n\nDefault: `false`\n\nYou may turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.\n\n```js\nrequire('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })\n```\n\n## Parse\n\nThe engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment\nvariables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return\nan Object with the parsed keys and values.\n\n```js\nconst dotenv = require('dotenv')\nconst buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')\nconst config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object\nconsole.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### Debug\n\nDefault: `false`\n\nYou may turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.\n\n```js\nconst dotenv = require('dotenv')\nconst buf = Buffer.from('hello world')\nconst opt = { debug: true }\nconst config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)\n// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form\n```\n\n### Rules\n\nThe parsing engine currently supports the following rules:\n\n- `BASIC=basic` becomes `{BASIC: 'basic'}`\n- empty lines are skipped\n- lines beginning with `#` are treated as comments\n- empty values become empty strings (`EMPTY=` becomes `{EMPTY: ''}`)\n- inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (`JSON={\"foo\": \"bar\"}` becomes `{JSON:\"{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\"}\"`)\n- whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on [`trim`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim)) (`FOO=  some value  ` becomes `{FOO: 'some value'}`)\n- single and double quoted values are escaped (`SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted'` becomes `{SINGLE_QUOTE: \"quoted\"}`)\n- single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (`FOO=\"  some value  \"` becomes `{FOO: '  some value  '}`)\n- double quoted values expand new lines (`MULTILINE=\"new\\nline\"` becomes\n\n```\n{MULTILINE: 'new\nline'}\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Should I commit my `.env` file?\n\nNo. We **strongly** recommend against committing your `.env` file to version\ncontrol. It should only include environment-specific values such as database\npasswords or API keys. Your production database should have a different\npassword than your development database.\n\n### Should I have multiple `.env` files?\n\nNo. We **strongly** recommend against having a \"main\" `.env` file and an \"environment\" `.env` file like `.env.test`. Your config should vary between deploys, and you should not be sharing values between environments.\n\n> In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as “environments”, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.\n>\n> – [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/config)\n\n### What happens to environment variables that were already set?\n\nWe will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your `.env` file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped. This behavior allows you to override all `.env` configurations with a machine-specific environment, although it is not recommended.\n\nIf you want to override `process.env` you can do something like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs')\nconst dotenv = require('dotenv')\nconst envConfig = dotenv.parse(fs.readFileSync('.env.override'))\nfor (const k in envConfig) {\n  process.env[k] = envConfig[k]\n}\n```\n\n### Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?\n\nFor `dotenv@2.x.x`: Yes. `dotenv.config()` now returns an object representing\nthe parsed `.env` file. This gives you everything you need to continue\nsetting values on `process.env`. For example:\n\n```js\nconst dotenv = require('dotenv')\nconst variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')\nconst myEnv = dotenv.config()\nvariableExpansion(myEnv)\n```\n\n### What about variable expansion?\n\nTry [dotenv-expand](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv-expand)\n\n### How do I use dotenv with `import`?\n\nES2015 and beyond offers modules that allow you to `export` any top-level `function`, `class`, `var`, `let`, or `const`.\n\n> When you run a module containing an `import` declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.\n>\n> – [ES6 In Depth: Modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/)\n\nYou must run `dotenv.config()` before referencing any environment variables. Here's an example of problematic code:\n\n`errorReporter.js`:\n\n```js\nimport { Client } from 'best-error-reporting-service'\n\nexport const client = new Client(process.env.BEST_API_KEY)\n```\n\n`index.js`:\n\n```js\nimport dotenv from 'dotenv'\nimport errorReporter from './errorReporter'\n\ndotenv.config()\nerrorReporter.client.report(new Error('faq example'))\n```\n\n`client` will not be configured correctly because it was constructed before `dotenv.config()` was executed. There are (at least) 3 ways to make this work.\n\n1. Preload dotenv: `node --require dotenv/config index.js` (_Note: you do not need to `import` dotenv with this approach_)\n2. Import `dotenv/config` instead of `dotenv` (_Note: you do not need to call `dotenv.config()` and must pass options via the command line or environment variables with this approach_)\n3. Create a separate file that will execute `config` first as outlined in [this comment on #133](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/issues/133#issuecomment-255298822)\n\n## Contributing Guide\n\nSee
