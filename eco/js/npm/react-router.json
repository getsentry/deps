If you are writing an application that will run in the browser, you should instead install `react-router-dom`. Similarly, if you are writing a React Native application, you should instead install `react-router-native`. Both of those will install `react-router` as a dependency.\n\nThen with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:\n\n```js\n// using ES6 modules\nimport { Router, Route, Switch } from \"react-router\";\n\n// using CommonJS modules\nvar Router = require(\"react-router\").Router;\nvar Route = require(\"react-router\").Route;\nvar Switch = require(\"react-router\").Switch;\n```\n\nThe UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-router/umd/react-router.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nYou can find the library on `window.ReactRouter`.\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you find a bug, please file an issue on [our issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues).\n\n## Credits\n\nReact Router is built and maintained by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com)."},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":3829597},{"from":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":18854397},{"from":"2021-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":57729913},{"from":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":116072188},{"from":"2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":218081795}],"dependentsCount":4109,"starsCount":259},"github":{"homepage":"https://reactrouter.com","starsCount":43856,"forksCount":8513,"subscribersCount":859,"issues":{"count":7957,"openCount":60,"distribution":{"3600":2122,"10800":1120,"32400":1567,"97200":951,"291600":477,"874800":462,"2624400":428,"7873200":520,"23619600":208,"70858800":83,"212576400":19},"isDisabled":false},"commits":[{"from":"2021-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":0}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":1379,"testsSize":55252,"hasChangelog":true},"badges":[{"urls":{"original":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router.svg?style=flat-square","shields":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router.json"},"info":{"service":"npm","type":"version","modifiers":{"type":"v"}}},{"urls":{"original":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router-dom.svg?style=flat-square","shields":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router-dom.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router-dom.json"},"info":{"service":"npm","type":"version","modifiers":{"type":"v"}}},{"urls":{"original":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router-native.svg?style=flat-square","shields":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router-native.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router-native.json"},"info":{"service":"npm","type":"version","modifiers":{"type":"v"}}},{"urls":{"original":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router-config.svg?style=flat-square","shields":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router-config.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router-config.json"},"info":{"service":"npm","type":"version","modifiers":{"type":"v"}}}],"linters":["eslint"],"outdatedDependencies":{"path-to-regexp":{"required":"^1.7.0","stable":"6.2.0","latest":"6.2.0"},"history":{"required":"^4.9.0","stable":"5.0.1","latest":"5.0.1"},"react-is":{"required":"^16.6.0","stable":"17.0.2","latest":"18.0.0-alpha-8723e772b-20210826"}}}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.9999999999999999,"tests":0.3,"health":0.5,"branding":0.6},"popularity":{"communityInterest":53487,"downloadsCount":19243304.333333332,"downloadsAcceleration":19589.16229071535,"dependentsCount":4109},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":1,"commitsFrequency":0,"openIssues":1,"issuesDistribution":0.9365499950831498}},"score":{"final":0.8146246043398102,"detail":{"quality":0.8226062355266751,"popularity":0.7890855690542197,"maintenance":0.833322241465231}}}
