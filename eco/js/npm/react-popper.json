wrapper around [Popper](https://popper.js.org).\n\n**important note:** Popper is **not** a tooltip library, it's a _positioning\nengine_ to be used to build features such as (but not restricted to) tooltips.\n\n## Install\n\nVia package managers:\n\n```bash\n# With npm\nnpm i react-popper @popperjs/core\n\n# With Yarn\nyarn add react-popper @popperjs/core\n```\n\n**Note:** `@popperjs/core` must be installed in your project in order for\n`react-popper` to work.\n\nVia `script` tag (UMD library exposed as `ReactPopper`):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-popper/dist/index.umd.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe full documentation can be found on the official Popper website:\n\nhttp://popper.js.org/react-popper\n\n\n## Running Locally\n\n#### clone repo\n\n`git clone git@github.com:FezVrasta/react-popper.git`\n\n#### move into folder\n\n`cd ~/react-popper`\n\n#### install dependencies\n\n`npm install` or `yarn`\n\n#### run dev mode\n\n`npm run demo:dev` or `yarn demo:dev`\n\n#### open your browser and visit:\n\n`http://localhost:1234/`"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","count":3600245},{"from":"2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","count":18600870},{"from":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","count":55691203},{"from":"2021-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","count":112430056},{"from":"2020-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","count":194872510}],"dependentsCount":1033,"starsCount":1},"github":{"homepage":"https://popper.js.org/react-popper/","starsCount":2078,"forksCount":215,"subscribersCount":17,"issues":{"count":426,"openCount":23,"distribution":{"3600":99,"10800":29,"32400":36,"97200":38,"291600":26,"874800":46,"2624400":53,"7873200":48,"23619600":32,"70858800":19,"212576400":0},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"JLarky","commitsCount":1},{"username":"patreeceeo","commitsCount":2},{"username":"pravdomil","commitsCount":1},{"username":"RobertBolender","commitsCount":1},{"username":"gnapse","commitsCount":1},{"username":"maclockard","commitsCount":5},{"username":"lyleunderwood","commitsCount":1},{"username":"wyozi","commitsCount":1},{"username":"SidKH","commitsCount":1},{"username":"nstepien","commitsCount":1},{"username":"zkuzmic","commitsCount":1},{"username":"FezVrasta","commitsCount":100},{"username":"guillaumepotier","commitsCount":1},{"username":"brentertz","commitsCount":1},{"username":"kumarharsh","commitsCount":1},{"username":"atomiks","commitsCount":3},{"username":"calvinf","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jamiewinder","commitsCount":2},{"username":"juanmaguitar","commitsCount":1},{"username":"davekiss","commitsCount":1},{"username":"shepmaster","commitsCount":1},{"username":"czycha","commitsCount":1},{"username":"TrySound","commitsCount":7},{"username":"kylegach","commitsCount":1},{"username":"dfernandez79","commitsCount":1},{"username":"inomdzhon","commitsCount":1},{"username":"sgrishchenko","commitsCount":1},{"username":"lluia","commitsCount":1},{"username":"souporserious","commitsCount":73},{"username":"ragurney","commitsCount":1},{"username":"piecyk","commitsCount":3},{"username":"miketmoore","commitsCount":1},{"username":"vkrol","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Gudahtt","commitsCount":1},{"username":"fleck","commitsCount":1},{"username":"TheSharpieOne","commitsCount":1},{"username":"giladgray","commitsCount":2},{"username":"gwyneplaine","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jquense","commitsCount":2},{"username":"oeb25","commitsCount":1},{"username":"maxmoeschinger","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ievax","commitsCount":1},{"username":"o-faro","commitsCount":1},{"username":"rek","commitsCount":1},{"username":"sibiraj-s","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Offirmo","commitsCount":1},{"username":"gargroh","commitsCount":1},{"username":"SpaceK33z","commitsCount":1},{"username":"maxjacobson","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mgroenhoff","commitsCount":1},{"username":"DrDyne","commitsCount":1},{"username":"pd4d10","commitsCount":3},{"username":"linusthe3rd","commitsCount":1},{"username":"okize","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mfedderly","commitsCount":1},{"username":"langovoi","commitsCount":2},{"username":"anirudhvarma12","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mohsinulhaq","commitsCount":1},{"username":"skimi","commitsCount":1},{"username":"tamias","commitsCount":1},{"username":"bengry","commitsCount":1},{"username":"xaviergonz","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Justkant","commitsCount":6},{"username":"richardvenneman","commitsCount":1},{"username":"oliviertassinari","commitsCount":1},{"username":"kiejo","commitsCount":1}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","count":1},{"from":"2021-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","count":4},{"from":"2020-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","count":9}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":2502,"testsSize":15839,"hasChangelog":true},"badges":[{"urls":{"original":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-popper.svg","shields":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-popper.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-popper.json"},"info":{"service":"npm","type":"version","modifiers":{"type":"v"}}},{"urls":{"original":"https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/react-popper.svg","shields":"https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/react-popper.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/react-popper.json"},"info":{"service":"npm","type":"downloads","modifiers":{"type":"dm"}}},{"urls":{"original":"https://david-dm.org/souporserious/react-popper.svg","service":"https://david-dm.org/souporserious/react-popper.svg","shields":"https://img.shields.io/david/souporserious/react-popper.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/david/souporserious/react-popper.json"},"info":{"service"
