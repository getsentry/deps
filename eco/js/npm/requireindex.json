The [test/lib](https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex/tree/master/test/lib) looks like:\n\n```\nlib/\n  index.js\n  Foo.js\n  bar/\n    index.js\n    f.js\n    fing.js\n    fed/\n      again.js\n      ignored.js\n      index.js\n      somemore.js\n  bam.js\n  _private.js\n\n```\n\nThe index.js files in [test/lib/](https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex/tree/master/test/lib/index.js) and [test/lib/bar/](https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex/tree/master/test/lib/bar/index.js) contain:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = require('requireindex')(__dirname);\n```\n\nand the index.js file in [test/lib/bar/fed/](https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex/tree/master/test/lib/bar/fed/index.js) contains:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = require('requireindex')(__dirname, ['again', 'somemore']);\n```\n\nThe optional second argument allows you to explicitly specify the required files using their basename. In this example [test/lib/bar/fed/ignored.js](https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex/tree/master/test/lib/bar/fed/ignored.js) is not included as a public module. The other way to make a module/file private without the need for explicitly naming all the other included files is to prefix the filename with an underscore, as demonstrated by [test/lib/_private.js](https://github.com/stephenhandley/requireindex/tree/master/test/lib/_private.js) which is not exported.\n\nSo, with these index.js files, the result of\n\n```js\nrequire('lib');\n```\n\nis:\n\n```js\n{\n  bam: {\n    m: [Function],\n    n: [Function]\n  },\n  bar: {\n    f: [Function],\n    fed: {\n      again: [Function],\n      somemore: [Function]\n    },\n    fing: [Function]\n  },\n  Foo: {\n    l: [Function],\n    ls: [Function]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#Build status\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stephenhandley/requireindex.png)](http://travis-ci.org/stephenhandley/requireindex)"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","count":43489},{"from":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","count":1329819},{"from":"2021-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","count":5749447},{"from":"2021-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","count":16834464},{"from":"2021-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","count":32674141},{"from":"2020-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","count":56332868}],"dependentsCount":971,"starsCount":2},"github":{"starsCount":76,"forksCount":11,"subscribersCount":8,"issues":{"count":12,"openCount":0,"distribution":{"3600":2,"10800":2,"32400":2,"97200":1,"291600":2,"874800":2,"2624400":1,"7873200":0,"23619600":0,"70858800":0,"212576400":0},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"stephenhandley","commitsCount":37},{"username":"eulalie367","commitsCount":1},{"username":"andrewrk","commitsCount":1}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2020-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","count":0}],"statuses":[{"context":"continuous-integration/travis-ci/push","state":"success"}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":2216,"testsSize":1962},"badges":[{"urls":{"original":"https://secure.travis-ci.org/stephenhandley/requireindex.png","service":"https://api.travis-ci.org/stephenhandley/requireindex.svg","shields":"https://img.shields.io/travis/stephenhandley/requireindex.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/travis/stephenhandley/requireindex.json"},"info":{"service":"travis","type":"build"}}]}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.71,"tests":0.85,"health":1,"branding":0.15},"popularity":{"communityInterest":100,"downloadsCount":5611488,"downloadsAcceleration":16124.497393455102,"dependentsCount":971},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":0.9,"commitsFrequency":0.9,"openIssues":1,"issuesDistribution":1}},"score":{"final":0.7903428807508541,"detail":{"quality":0.9269780657740839,"popularity":0.4636293158793275,"maintenance":0.9999405727453268}}}
