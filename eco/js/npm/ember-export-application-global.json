Specify if you want the global to be exported.\n  A `true` will export global as the application name, but a string will export\n  is as that string.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember addon.\n\n### Installation\n\n* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository\n* `cd ember-export-application-global`\n* `npm install`\n* `bower install`\n\n## Running\n\n* `ember serve`\n* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).\n\n## Running Tests\n\n* `npm test` (Runs `ember try:each` to test your addon against multiple Ember versions)\n* `ember test`\n* `ember test --server`\n\n## Building\n\n* `ember build`\n\nFor more information on using ember-cli, visit [http://ember-cli.com/](http://ember-cli.com/).\n\n## License\n\nMIT"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","count":5092},{"from":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","count":114119},{"from":"2021-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","count":482111},{"from":"2021-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","count":1502729},{"from":"2021-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","count":3222313},{"from":"2020-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","count":5881784}],"dependentsCount":13,"starsCount":0},"github":{"starsCount":15,"forksCount":16,"subscribersCount":8,"issues":{"count":179,"openCount":8,"distribution":{"3600":69,"10800":14,"32400":6,"97200":4,"291600":8,"874800":15,"2624400":14,"7873200":36,"23619600":10,"70858800":1,"212576400":2},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"rwjblue","commitsCount":15},{"username":"JamesS-M","commitsCount":1},{"username":"tricknotes","commitsCount":1},{"username":"dependabot-preview[bot]","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Kuzirashi","commitsCount":2},{"username":"mike-north","commitsCount":2},{"username":"ember-tomster","commitsCount":1},{"username":"dependabot[bot]","commitsCount":11},{"username":"kellyselden","commitsCount":1},{"username":"shokmaster","commitsCount":1},{"username":"johanneswuerbach","commitsCount":2},{"username":"Turbo87","commitsCount":10},{"username":"stefanpenner","commitsCount":15}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","count":2},{"from":"2021-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","count":5},{"from":"2020-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","count":14}],"statuses":[{"context":"continuous-integration/travis-ci/push","state":"error"}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":2069,"testsSize":9045,"hasNpmIgnore":true},"badges":[{"urls":{"original":"https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/ember-export-application-global.svg?branch=master","service":"https://api.travis-ci.org/ember-cli/ember-export-application-global.svg?branch=master","shields":"https://img.shields.io/travis/ember-cli/ember-export-application-global/master.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/travis/ember-cli/ember-export-application-global/master.json"},"info":{"service":"travis","type":"build","modifiers":{"branch":"master"}}},{"urls":{"original":"https://david-dm.org/ember-cli/ember-export-application-global/dev-status.svg","service":"https://david-dm.org/ember-cli/ember-export-application-global/dev-status.svg","shields":"https://img.shields.io/david/dev/ember-cli/ember-export-application-global.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/david/dev/ember-cli/ember-export-application-global.json"},"info":{"service":"david","type":"dependencies","modifiers":{"statusType":"dev"}}}],"linters":["editorconfig"]}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.9199999999999999,"tests":0.6,"health":1,"branding":0.3},"popularity":{"communityInterest":52,"downloadsCount":500909.6666666667,"downloadsAcceleration":435.78803272450523,"dependentsCount":13},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":0.9,"commitsFrequency":0.9,"openIssues":1,"issuesDistribution":0.9}},"score":{"final":0.7021373918380261,"detail":{"quality":0.930098667272069,"popularity":0.20898487342650424,"maintenance":0.999894531306083}}}
