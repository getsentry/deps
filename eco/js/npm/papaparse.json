It is reliable and correct according to [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180), and it comes with these features:\n\n- Easy to use\n- Parse CSV files directly (local or over the network)\n- Fast mode ([is really fast](http://jsperf.com/javascript-csv-parsers/3))\n- Stream large files (even via HTTP)\n- Reverse parsing (converts JSON to CSV)\n- Auto-detect delimiter\n- Worker threads to keep your web page reactive\n- Header row support\n- Pause, resume, abort\n- Can convert numbers and booleans to their types\n- Optional jQuery integration to get files from `<input type=\"file\">` elements\n- One of the only parsers that correctly handles line-breaks and quotations\n\nPapa Parse has **no dependencies** - not even jQuery.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\npapaparse is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/papaparse). It\ncan be installed with the following command:\n\n    npm install papaparse\n\nIf you don't want to use npm, [papaparse.min.js](https://unpkg.com/papaparse@latest/papaparse.min.js) can be downloaded to your project source.\n\n\nHomepage & Demo\n----------------\n\n- [Homepage](http://papaparse.com)\n- [Demo](http://papaparse.com/demo)\n\nTo learn how to use Papa Parse:\n\n- [Documentation](http://papaparse.com/docs)\n\nThe website is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Its content is also included in the docs folder of this repository. If you want to contribute on it just clone the master of this repository and open a pull request.\n\n\nPapa Parse for Node\n--------------------\n\nPapa Parse can parse a [Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) instead of a [File](https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/) when used in Node.js environments (in addition to plain strings). In this mode, `encoding` must, if specified, be a Node-supported character encoding. The `Papa.LocalChunkSize`, `Papa.RemoteChunkSize` , `download`, `withCredentials` and `worker` config options are unavailable.\n\nPapa Parse can also parse in a node streaming style which makes `.pipe` available.  Simply pipe the [Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) to the stream returned from `Papa.parse(Papa.NODE_STREAM_INPUT, options)`.  The `Papa.LocalChunkSize`, `Papa.RemoteChunkSize` , `download`, `withCredentials`, `worker`, `step`, and `complete` config options are unavailable.  To register a callback with the stream to process data, use the `data` event like so: `stream.on('data', callback)` and to signal the end of stream, use the 'end' event like so: `stream.on('end', callback)`.\n\nGet Started\n-----------\n\nFor usage instructions, see the [homepage](http://papaparse.com) and, for more detail, the [documentation](http://papaparse.com/docs).\n\nTests\n-----\n\nPapa Parse is under test. Download this repository, run `npm install`, then `npm test` to run the tests.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nTo discuss a new feature or ask a question, open an issue. To fix a bug, submit a pull request to be credited with the [contributors](https://github.com/mholt/PapaParse/graphs/contributors)! Remember, a pull request, *with test*, is best. You may also discuss on Twitter with [#PapaParse](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PapaParse&src=typd&f=realtime) or directly to me, [@mholt6](https://twitter.com/mholt6).\n\nIf you contribute a patch, ensure the tests suite is running correctly. We run continuous integration on each pull request and will not accept a patch that breaks the tests."},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","count":27549},{"from":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","count":761053},{"from":"2021-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","count":3075197},{"from":"2021-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","count":9223600},{"from":"2021-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","count":18236507},{"from":"2020-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","count":31972226}],"dependentsCount":600,"starsCount":24},"github":{"homepage":"http://PapaParse.com","starsCount":9870,"forksCount":1034,"subscribersCount":159,"issues":{"count":887,"openCount":138,"distribution":{"3600":116,"10800":61,"32400":75,"97200":81,"291600":75,"874800":81,"2624400":91,"7873200":70,"23619600":74,"70858800":94,"212576400":69},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"jimmywarting","commitsCount":1},{"username":"UnnitMetaliya","commitsCount":1},{"username":"baerrach","commitsCount":1},{"username":"cesarandreu","commitsCount":1},{"username":"gabegorelick","commitsCount":12},{"username":"iliasbhal","commitsCount":1},{"username":"phanect","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jaybowles","commitsCount":1},{"username":"t83714","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ledbit","commitsCount":1},{"username":"chriszs","commitsCount":1},{"username":"DanzelTaccayan","commitsCount":1},{"username":"caesarsol","commitsCount":1},{"username":"pushplay","commitsCount":1},{"username":"cKlee","commitsCount":1},{"username":"marshall007","commitsCount":1},{"username":"topicus","commitsCount":1},{"username":"hanwiz","commitsCount":1},{"username":"MonkeyDZeke","commitsCount":6},{"username":"mholt","commitsCount":153},{"username":"G3z","commitsCount":1},{"username":"hacknlove","commitsCount":2},{"username":"konuch","commitsCount":2},{"username":"briancullinan","commitsCount":1},{"username":"swantzter","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jbzorg","commitsCount":1},{"username":"GraceDmello","commitsCount":1},{"username":"vurral","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ommaralquisi","commitsCount":1},{"username":"robd","commitsCount":5},{"username":"janisdd","commitsCount":6},{"username":"varunsharma27","commitsCount":2},{"username":"hyandell","commitsCount":1},{"username":"trevorharwell","commitsCount":2},{"username":"breck7","commitsCount":1},{"username":"vyrak","commitsCount":1},{"username":"seachicken","commitsCount":2},{"username":"DaHaiz","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Kazetsukai","commitsCount":1},{"username":"badosu","commitsCount":1},{"username":"sandstrom","commitsCount":1},{"username":"catgofire","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jkradddic","commitsCount":1},{"username":"dinoboff","commitsCount":1},{"username":"nosovk","commitsCount":1},{"username":"lunatixcoder","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Puzzleton","commitsCount":1},{"username":"johnsardine","commitsCount":1},{"username":"runejuhl","commitsCount":1},{"username":"pokoli","commitsCount":79},{"username":"villeahy","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jsg2021","commitsCount":3},{"username":"akshaybabloo","commitsCount":1},{"username":"tomByrer","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jefbarn","commitsCount":1},{"username":"marius-wieschollek","commitsCount":1},{"username":"wicz","commitsCount":1},{"username":"demetris-manikas","commitsCount":1},{"username":"efossas","commitsCount":3},{"username":"dimitropoulos","commitsCount":1},{"username":"IceOnFire","commitsCount":2},{"username":"jscheid","commitsCount":3},{"username":"bluej100","commitsCount":12},{"username":"furey","commitsCount":1},{"username":"LeviticusMB","commitsCount":1},{"username":"adamlc","commitsCount":1},{"username":"wcerfgba","commitsCount":1},{"username":"FirstVertex","commitsCount":2},{"username":"ConnorSmith-pf","commitsCount":1},{"username":"adiroiban","commitsCount":2},{"username":"mfds","commitsCount":1},{"username":"pschlatt","commitsCount":1},{"username":"j--w","commitsCount":1},{"username":"tijszwinkels","commitsCount":2},{"username":"0xflotus","commitsCount":1},{"username":"oleersoy","commitsCount":1},{"username":"alexandresaiz","commitsCount":1},{"username":"andekande","commitsCount":1},{"username":"theill","commitsCount":1},{"username":"dboskovic","commitsCount":1},{"username":"haxxxton","commitsCount":1},{"username":"thSteve","commitsCount":1},{"username":"nikolas","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ncolgrove","commitsCount":1},{"username":"billstron","commitsCount":2},{"username":"prayashm","commitsCount":2},{"username":"thebetternewt","commitsCount":1},{"username":"AstroAndyN","commitsCount":1},{"username":"edg2s","commitsCount":3},{"username":"jbelien","commitsCount":1},{"username":"duclet","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jacopofar","commitsCount":1},{"username":"p4ul","commitsCount":1},{"username":"FarSeeing","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mauriciovillalobos","commitsCount":1},{"username":"shamess","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Turbo87","commitsCount":10},{"username":"natemcmaster","commitsCount":1},{"usern
