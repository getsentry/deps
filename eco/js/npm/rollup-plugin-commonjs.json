Pass an array containing the IDs\n      // or a `id => boolean` function. Only use this\n      // option if you know what you're doing!\n      ignore: [ 'conditional-runtime-dependency' ]\n    })\n  ]\n};\n```\n\n### Usage with symlinks\n\nSymlinks are common in monorepos and are also created by the `npm link` command. Rollup with `rollup-plugin-node-resolve` resolves modules to their real paths by default. So `include` and `exclude` paths should handle real paths rather than symlinked paths (e.g. `../common/node_modules/**` instead of `node_modules/**`). You may also use a regular expression for `include` that works regardless of base path. Try this:\n\n```\ncommonjs({\n  include: /node_modules/\n})\n```\n\nWhether symlinked module paths are [realpathed](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/realpath.3.html) or preserved depends on Rollup's `preserveSymlinks` setting, which is false by default, matching Node.js' default behavior. Setting `preserveSymlinks` to true in your Rollup config will cause `import` and `export` to match based on symlinked paths instead.\n\n### Custom named exports\n\nThis plugin will attempt to create named exports, where appropriate, so you can do this...\n\n```js\n// importer.js\nimport { named } from './exporter.js';\n\n// exporter.js\nmodule.exports = { named: 42 }; // or `exports.named = 42;`\n```\n\n...but that's not always possible:\n\n```js\n// importer.js\nimport { named } from 'my-lib';\n\n// my-lib.js\nvar myLib = exports;\nmyLib.named = 'you can\\'t see me';\n```\n\nIn those cases, you can specify custom named exports:\n\n```js\ncommonjs({\n  namedExports: {\n    // left-hand side can be an absolute path, a path\n    // relative to the current directory, or the name\n    // of a module in node_modules\n    'my-lib': [ 'named' ]\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n## Strict mode\n\nES modules are *always* parsed in strict mode. That means that certain non-strict constructs (like octal literals) will be treated as syntax errors when Rollup parses modules that use them. Some older CommonJS modules depend on those constructs, and if you depend on them your bundle will blow up. There's basically nothing we can do about that.\n\nLuckily, there is absolutely no good reason *not* to use strict mode for everything â€” so the solution to this problem is to lobby the authors of those modules to update them.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":265608},{"from":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":1338219},{"from":"2021-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":4345189},{"from":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":9715933},{"from":"2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":20224531}],"dependentsCount":1093,"starsCount":4},"github":{"starsCount":488,"forksCount":125,"subscribersCount":22,"issues":{"count":423,"openCount":0,"distribution":{"3600":45,"10800":14,"32400":21,"97200":30,"291600":27,"874800":30,"2624400":39,"7873200":66,"23619600":47,"70858800":74,"212576400":30},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"DenisCarriere","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jthoms1","commitsCount":3},{"username":"caleb531","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jharris4","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Torsten85","commitsCount":1},{"username":"MaartenX","commitsCount":2},{"username":"mbostock","commitsCount":3},{"username":"btd","commitsCount":1},{"username":"adrianheine","commitsCount":5},{"username":"lautis","commitsCount":1},{"username":"pshrmn","commitsCount":2},{"username":"otolab","commitsCount":5},{"username":"Manduro","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Rich-Harris","commitsCount":142},{"username":"vinkla","commitsCount":1},{"username":"bhousel","commitsCount":1},{"username":"madbence","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Victorystick","commitsCount":2},{"username":"porsager","commitsCount":1},{"username":"guybedford","commitsCount":10},{"username":"lukastaegert","commitsCount":65},{"username":"amilajack","commitsCount":1},{"username":"tivac","commitsCount":4},{"username":"NotWoods","commitsCount":2},{"username":"lukeapage","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jnields","commitsCount":2},{"username":"Tundon","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ntilwalli","commitsCount":1},{"username":"dmitrage","commitsCount":2},{"username":"unstubbable","commitsCount":4},{"username":"nicolashenry","commitsCount":2},{"username":"eventualbuddha","commitsCount":1},{"username":"shellscape","commitsCount":2},{"username":"marijnh","commitsCount":1},{"username":"sormy","commitsCount":1},{"username":"bterlson","commitsCount":4},{"username":"dralletje","commitsCount":1},{"username":"TrySound","commitsCount":20},{"username":"creationix","commitsCount":1},{"username":"tionkje","commitsCount":1},{"username":"aleclarson","commitsCount":1},{"username":"opichals","commitsCount":1},{"username":"NathanielHill","commitsCount":1},{"username":"maranomynet","commitsCount":1},{"username":"MattiasBuelens","commitsCount":5},{"username":"calvinmetcalf","commitsCount":3},{"username":"bfred-it","commitsCount":1}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","count":0}],"statuses":[{"context":"continuous-integration/travis-ci/push","state":"success"},{"context":"continuous-integration/appveyor/branch","state":"success"}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":4200,"testsSize":40134,"hasChangelog":true},"badges":[{"urls":{"original":"https://travis-ci.org/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs.svg","service":"https://api.travis-ci.org/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs.svg","shields":"https://img.shields.io/travis/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/travis/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs.json"},"info":{"service":"travis","type":"build"}}],"linters":["eslint","prettier"],"outdatedDependencies":{"is-reference":{"required":"^1.1.2","stable":"3.0.0","latest":"3.0.0"},"estree-walker":{"required":"^0.6.1","stable":"3.0.0","latest":"3.0.0"}}}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0,"tests":0.85,"health":0.5,"branding":0.15},"popularity":{"communityInterest":686,"downloadsCount":1448396.3333333333,"downloadsAcceleration":-3058.6605974124795,"dependentsCount":1093},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":0.012328767123287673,"commitsFrequency":0,"openIssues":1,"issuesDistribution":0}},"score":{"final":0.36339526542285977,"detail":{"quality":0.555132562031337,"popularity":0.3830556749538071,"maintenance":0.17938860165607495}}}
