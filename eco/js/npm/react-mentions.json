It takes one or multiple `Mention` components as its children. Each `Mention` component represents a data source for a specific class of mentionable objects, such as users, template variables, issues, etc.\n\nExample:\n\n```jsx\n<MentionsInput value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange}>\n  <Mention\n    trigger=\"@\"\n    data={this.props.users}\n    renderSuggestion={this.renderUserSuggestion}\n  />\n  <Mention\n    trigger=\"#\"\n    data={this.requestTag}\n    renderSuggestion={this.renderTagSuggestion}\n  />\n</MentionsInput>\n```\n\nYou can find more examples here: [demo/src/examples](https://github.com/signavio/react-mentions/tree/master/demo/src/examples)\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe `MentionsInput` supports the following props for configuring the widget:\n\n| Prop name                   | Type                                                    | Default value  | Description                                                                            |\n|

suggestionsPortalHost       | DOM Element                                             | undefined      | Render suggestions into the DOM in the supplied host element.                          |\n| inputRef                    | React ref                                               | undefined      | Accepts a React ref to forward to the underlying input element                         |\n| allowSuggestionsAboveCursor | boolean                                                 | false          | Renders the SuggestionList above the cursor if there is not enough space below         |\n| a11ySuggestionsListLabel    | string                                                  | `''`           | This label would be exposed to screen readers when suggestion popup appears            |\n\nEach data source is configured using a `Mention` component, which has the following props:\n\n| Prop name        | Type                                                         | Default value                               | Description                                                                                                                                            |\n| ----------------

       |\n| markup           | string                                                       | `'@[__display__](__id__)'`                  | A template string for the markup to use for mentions                                                                                                   |\n| displayTransform | function (id, display)                                       | returns `display`                           | Accepts a function for customizing the string that is displayed for a mention                                                                          |\n| regex            | RegExp                                                       | automatically derived from `markup` pattern | Allows providing a custom regular expression for parsing your markup and extracting the placeholder interpolations (optional)                          |  |\n| onAdd            | function (id, display, startPos, endPos)                                       | empty function                              | Callback invoked when a suggestion has been added (optional)                                                                                           |\n| appendSpaceOnAdd | boolean                                                      | `false`                                     | Append a space when a suggestion has been added (optional)                                                                                             |\n\nIf a function is passed as the `data` prop, that function will be called with the current search query as first, and a callback function as second argument. The callback can be used to provide results asynchronously, e.g., after fetch requests. (It can even be called multiple times to update the list of suggestions.)\n\n## Styling\n\n_react-mentions_ supports css, css modules, and inline styles. It is shipped with only some essential inline style definitions and without any css. Some example inline styles demonstrating how to customize the appearance of the `MentionsInput` can be found at [demo/src/examples/defaultStyle.js](https://github.com/signavio/react-mentions/blob/master/demo/src/examples/defaultStyle.js).\n\nIf you want to use css, simply assign a `className` prop to `MentionsInput`. All DOM nodes rendered by the component will then receive class name attributes that are derived from the base class name you provided.\n\nIf you want to avoid global class names and use css modules instead, you can provide the automatically generated class names as `classNames` to the `MentionsInput`. See [demo/src/examples/CssModules.js](https://github.com/signavio/react-mentions/blob/master/demo/src/examples/CssModules.js) for an example of using _react-mentions_ with css modules.\n\nYou can also assign `className` and `style` props to the `Mention` elements to define how to highlight the mentioned words.\n\n## Testing\n\nDue to react-mentions' internal cursor tracking it is not good enough to simulate the editing of the textarea value using `ReactTestUtils.Simulate.change`.\nWe recommend using [@testing-library/user-event](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event) for a realistic simulation of events as they would happen in the browser as the user interacts the textarea.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSpawn a development server with an example page and module hot loading all set up:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nUpdate the examples page on Github Pages:\n\n```\nnpm run pages-publish\n```\n\n[build-badge]:
