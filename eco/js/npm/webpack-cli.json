As of webpack v4, webpack is not expecting a configuration file, but often developers want to create a more custom webpack configuration based on their use-cases and needs. webpack CLI addresses these needs by providing a set of tools to improve the setup of custom webpack configuration.\n\n## How to install\n\nWhen you have followed the [Getting Started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) guide of webpack then webpack CLI is already installed!\n\nOtherwise\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev webpack-cli\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nyarn add webpack-cli --dev\n```\n\n## Supported arguments and commands\n\n### Usage\n\nAll interactions with webpack-cli are of the form\n\n```bash\nnpx webpack-cli [command] [options]\n```\n\nIf no command is specified then `bundle` command is used by default\n\n### Help Usage\n\nTo display basic commands and arguments -\n\n```bash\nnpx webpack-cli --help\n```\n\nTo display all supported commands and arguments -\n\n```bash\nnpx webpack-cli --help=verbose\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nnpx webpack-cli --help verbose\n```\n\n### Available Commands\n\n```\n  build|bundle|b [entries...] [options]                 Run webpack (default command, can be omitted).\n  configtest|t [config-path]                            Validate a webpack configuration.\n  help|h [command] [option]                             Display help for commands and options.\n  info|i [options]                                      Outputs information about your system.\n  init|create|new|c|n [generation-path] [options]       Initialize a new webpack project.\n  loader|l [output-path] [options]                      Scaffold a loader.\n  migrate|m <config-path> [new-config-path]             Migrate a configuration to a new version.\n  plugin|p [output-path] [options]                      Scaffold a plugin.\n  serve|server|s [entries...] [options]                 Run the webpack dev server.\n  version|v [commands...]                               Output the version number of 'webpack', 'webpack-cli' and 'webpack-dev-server' and commands.\n  watch|w [entries...] [options]                        Run webpack and watch for files changes.\n```\n\n### webpack 4\n\n```\n  Options:\n  --analyze                     It invokes webpack-bundle-analyzer plugin to get bundle information\n  -c, --config <value...>       Provide path to a webpack configuration file e.g. ./webpack.config.js.\n  --config-name <value...>      Name of the configuration to use.\n  -m, --merge                   Merge two or more configurations using 'webpack-merge'.\n  --env <value...>              Environment passed to the configuration when it is a function.\n  --node-env <value>            Sets process.env.NODE_ENV to the specified value.\n  --progress [value]            Print compilation progress during build.\n  -j, --json [value]            Prints result as JSON or store it in a file.\n  -d, --devtool <value>         Determine source maps to use.\n  --no-devtool                  Do not generate source maps.\n  --entry <value...>            The entry point(s) of your application e.g. ./src/main.js.\n  -h, --hot [value]             Enables Hot Module Replacement\n  --no-hot                      Disables Hot Module Replacement\n  --mode <value>                Defines the mode to pass to webpack.\n  --name <value>                Name of the configuration.
