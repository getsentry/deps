Automatically._\n\nMobX is a battle tested library that makes state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming (TFRP).\nThe philosophy behind MobX is simple:\n\n<div class=\"benefits\">\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"pic\">üòô</div>\n        <div>\n            <h5>Straightforward</h5>\n            <p>Write minimalistic, boilerplate free code that captures your intent.\n            Trying to update a record field? Use the good old JavaScript assignment.\n            Updating data in an asynchronous process? No special tools are required, the reactivity system will detect all your changes and propagate them out to where they are being used.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"pic\">üöÖ</div>\n        <div>\n            <h5>Effortless optimal rendering</h5>\n            <p>\n                All changes to and uses of your data are tracked at runtime, building a dependency tree that captures all relations between state and output.\n                This guarantees that computations depending on your state, like React components, run only when strictly needed.\n                There is no need to manually optimize components with error-prone and sub-optimal techniques like memoization and selectors.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"pic\">ü§πüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</div>\n        <div>\n            <h5>Architectural freedom</h5>\n            <p>\n                MobX is unopinionated and allows you to manage your application state outside of any UI framework.\n                This makes your code decoupled, portable, and above all, easily testable.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## A quick example\n\nSo what does code that uses MobX look like?\n\n```javascript\nimport React from \"react\"\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\"\nimport { makeAutoObservable } from \"mobx\"\nimport { observer } from \"mobx-react\"\n\n// Model the application state.\nclass Timer {\n    secondsPassed = 0\n\n    constructor() {\n        makeAutoObservable(this)\n    }\n\n    increase() {\n        this.secondsPassed += 1\n    }\n\n    reset() {\n        this.secondsPassed = 0\n    }\n}\n\nconst myTimer = new Timer()\n\n// Build a \"user interface\" that uses the observable state.\nconst TimerView = observer(({ timer }) => (\n    <button onClick={() => timer.reset()}>Seconds passed: {timer.secondsPassed}</button>\n))\n\nReactDOM.render(<TimerView timer={myTimer} />, document.body)\n\n// Update the 'Seconds passed: X' text every second.\nsetInterval(() => {\n    myTimer.increase()\n}, 1000)\n```\n\nThe `observer` wrapper around the `TimerView` React component, will automatically detect that rendering\ndepends on the `timer.secondsPassed` observable, even though this relationship is not explicitly defined. The reactivity system will take care of re-rendering the component when _precisely that_ field is updated in the future.\n\nEvery event (`onClick` / `setInterval`) invokes an _action_ (`myTimer.increase` / `myTimer.reset`) that updates _observable state_ (`myTimer.secondsPassed`).\nChanges in the observable state are propagated precisely to all _computations_ and _side effects_ (`TimerView`) that depend on the changes being made.\n\n<img alt=\"MobX unidirectional flow\" src=\"https://mobx.js.org/assets/flow2.png\" align=\"center\" />\n\nThis conceptual picture can be applied to the above example, or any other application using MobX.\n\nTo learn about the core concepts of MobX using a larger example, check out [The gist of MobX](docs/the-gist-of-mobx.md) section, or take the [10 minute interactive introduction to MobX and React](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started).\nThe philosophy and benefits of the mental model provided by MobX are also described in great detail in the blog posts [UI as an afterthought](https://michel.codes/blogs/ui-as-an-afterthought) and [How to decouple state and UI (a.k.a. you don‚Äôt need componentWillMount)](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-decouple-state-and-ui-a-k-a-you-dont-need-componentwillmount-cc90b787aa37).\n\n<div class=\"cheat\"><a href=\"https://gum.co/fSocU\"><button title=\"Download the MobX 6 cheat sheet and sponsor the project\">Download the MobX 6 cheat sheet</button></a></div>\n\n## What others are saying...\n\n> Guise, #mobx isn't pubsub, or your grandpa's observer pattern. Nay, it is a carefully orchestrated observable dimensional portal fueled by the power cosmic. It doesn't do change detection, it's actually a level 20 psionic with soul knife, slashing your viewmodel into submission.\n\n> After using #mobx for lone projects for a few weeks, it feels awesome to introduce it to the team. Time: 1/2, Fun: 2X\n\n> Working with #mobx is basically a continuous loop of me going ‚Äúthis is way too simple, it definitely won‚Äôt work‚Äù only to be proven wrong\n\n> I have built big apps with MobX already and comparing to the one before that which was using Redux, it is simpler to read and much easier to reason about.\n\n> The #mobx is the way I always want things to be! It's really surprising simple and fast! Totally awesome! Don't miss it!\n\n## Further resources and documentation\n\n-   [MobX cheat sheet (also sponsors the project)](https://gum.co/fSocU)\n-   [10 minute interactive introduction to MobX and React](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started)\n-   [Egghead.io course, based on MobX 3](https://egghead.io/courses/manage-complex-state-in-react-apps-with-mobx)\n\n### The MobX book\n\n[<img src=\"https://mobx.js.org/assets/book.jpg\" height=\"80px\"/> ](https://books.google.nl/books?id=ALFmDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&dq=michel+weststrate+mobx+quick+start+guide:+supercharge+the+client+state+in+your+react+apps+with+mobx&source=bl&ots=D460fxti0F&sig=ivDGTxsPNwlOjLHrpKF1nweZFl8&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiwl8XO--ncAhWPmbQKHWOYBqIQ6AEwAnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=michel%20weststrate%20mobx%20quick%20start%20guide%3A%20supercharge%20the%20client%20state%20in%20your%20react%20apps%20with%20mobx&f=false)\n\nCreated by [Pavan Podila](https://twitter.com/pavanpodila) and [Michel Weststrate](https://twitter.com/mweststrate).\n\n### Videos\n\n-   [Introduction to MobX & React in 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnhIJA64ByY) by Leigh Halliday, _17min_.\n-   [ReactNext 2016: Real World MobX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aws40KOx90U) by Michel Weststrate, _40min_, [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DrI6Hc2xIPTLBkfNH8YczOcPXQTOaCIcDESdyVfG_bE/edit?usp=sharing).\n-   [CityJS 2020: MobX, from mutable to immutable, to observable data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHxFrbK3VB0&feature=emb_logo) by Michel Weststrate, _30min_.\n-   [OpenSourceNorth: Practical React with MobX (ES5)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGwuM_u7UeQ) by Matt Ruby, _42min_.\n-   [HolyJS 2019: MobX and the unique symbiosis of predictability and speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBYbBbjZeX4&list=PL8sJahqnzh8JJD7xahG5zXkjfM5GOgcPA&index=21&t=0s) by Michel Weststrate, _59min_.\n-   [React Amsterdam 2016: State Management Is Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApmSsu3qnf0&feature=youtu.be) by Michel Weststrate, _20min_, [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/mweststrate/state-management-is-easy-introduction-to-mobx).\n-   {üöÄ} [React Live 2019: Reinventing MobX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_WqKZxpX8g) by Max Gallo, _27min_.\n\nAnd an all around [MobX awesome list](https://github.com/mobxjs/awesome-mobx#awesome-mobx).\n\n## Credits\n\nMobX is inspired by reactive programming principles as found in the spreadsheets. It is inspired by MVVM frameworks like MeteorJS tracker, knockout and Vue.js, but MobX brings _Transparent Functional Reactive Programming_ to the next level and provides a standalone implementation. It implements TFRP in a glitch-free, synchronous, predictable and efficient manner.\n\nA ton of credits goes to [Mendix](https://github.com/mendix), for providing the flexibility and support to maintain MobX and the chance to proof the philosophy of MobX in a real, complex, performance critical
