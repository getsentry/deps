I am happy to fix bugs, but generally am not interested in adding more to the library.\n\nI also maintain [messageformat.js](https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js). If you don't specifically need a gettext implementation, I might suggest using MessageFormat instead, as it has better support for plurals/gender and has built-in locale data.\n\n\n## Parsing Gettext Files\n\nJed doesn't include a Gettext file parser, but several third-party parsers exist that can have their output adapted for Jed.\n\n#### Node\n\nJust search the npm repository, there are several PO and MO file parsers available.\n\n#### Browser\n\n[Jed Gettext Parser](https://github.com/WrinklyNinja/jed-gettext-parser) is the only known browser MO file parser, and it also works in Node, and outputs Jed-compatible data directly.\n\n[gettext.js](https://code.google.com/p/gettext-js) and [Pomo.js](https://github.com/cfv1984/pomo) both include browser-compatible PO file parsers.\n\n## Todo\n\n* Build time generation of plural form functions\n* Web interface for building translation sets\n* Code introspection for default values\n\n## License\n\nJed is a member project of the [jQuery Foundation](https://jquery.org/)\n\nYou may use this software under the MIT License.\n\nYou may contribute to this software under the jQuery Foundation CLA - <https://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/>\n\n\n## Author\n\n* Alex Sexton - @slexaxton - <https://alexsexton.com/>\n\n\n## Credits\n\nA good chunk of sanity checking was done against the gettext.js tests. That was written by:\n\n* Joshua I. Miller\n\nThe sprintf implementation is from:\n\n* Alexandru Marasteanu <alexaholic [at) gmail (dot] com>\n\n\n## The name\n\nThe name jed.js is an homage to Jed Schmidt (<https://github.com/jed>) the JavaScript community member who is a japanese translator by day, and a \"hobbyist\" JavaScript programmer by night. Give your kids three character names and they'll probably get software named after them too."},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":98704},{"from":"2021-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":455443},{"from":"2021-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":1395271},{"from":"2021-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":2839633},{"from":"2020-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":5507038}],"dependentsCount":54,"starsCount":5},"github":{"homepage":"http://messageformat.github.io/Jed","starsCount":869,"forksCount":73,"subscribersCount":27,"issues":{"count":63,"openCount":17,"distribution":{"3600":7,"10800":5,"32400":5,"97200":4,"291600":1,"874800":3,"2624400":3,"7873200":1,"23619600":6,"70858800":12,"212576400":16},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"SlexAxton","commitsCount":41},{"username":"m-khvoinitsky","commitsCount":1},{"username":"kborchers","commitsCount":2},{"username":"Sinewyk","commitsCount":1},{"username":"joshmh","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mcd-php","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jayclassless","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Rob--W","commitsCount":1},{"username":"kastigar","commitsCount":1},{"username":"TiS","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Ortham","commitsCount":2},{"username":"danmactough","commitsCount":1},{"username":"andrey-yantsen","commitsCount":1},{"username":"jeslabs","commitsCount":1},{"username":"spladug","commitsCount":1},{"username":"psilva261","commitsCount":2},{"username":"jMort","commitsCount":2},{"username":"swissspidy","commitsCount":1}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2020-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","count":0}],"statuses":[{"context":"continuous-integration/travis-ci/push","state":"error"}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":2247,"testsSize":127991},"badges":[{"urls":{"original":"https://secure.travis-ci.org/SlexAxton/Jed.png","service":"https://api.travis-ci.org/SlexAxton/Jed.svg","shields":"https://img.shields.io/travis/SlexAxton/Jed.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/travis/SlexAxton/Jed.json"},"info":{"service":"travis","type":"build"}}]}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.71,"tests":0.6,"health":1,"branding":0.15},"popularity":{"communityInterest":992,"downloadsCount":465090.3333333333,"downloadsAcceleration":195.40538432267886,"dependentsCount":54},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":0,"commitsFrequency":0,"openIssues":0.8835978835978836,"issuesDistribution":0}},"score":{"final":0.4291400828701505,"detail":{"quality":0.8918654227445982,"popularity":0.2950394242782602,"maintenance":0.16661902156965702}}}
