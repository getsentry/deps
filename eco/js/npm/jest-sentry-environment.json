'ci' : 'local',\n        tracesSampleRate: 1.0,\n      },\n\n      transactionOptions: {\n        // `tags` will be used for the test suite transaction\n        tags: {\n          branch: process.env.GITHUB_REF,\n          commit: process.env.GITHUB_SHA,\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nYou can either import the jsdom or node environments. You can also customize the base environment by specifying your own `testEnvironment`.\n\n```json\ntestEnvironment: './path/to/env.js',\n```\n\nIn `./path/to/env.js`:\n\n```javascript\nconst {createEnvironment} = require('jest-sentry-environment');\n\nreturn createEnvironment({\n  baseEnvironment: require('jest-environment-node'),\n});\n```"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","count":36},{"from":"2021-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","count":36},{"from":"2021-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","count":36},{"from":"2021-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","count":36},{"from":"2020-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","count":36}],"dependentsCount":0,"starsCount":0},"github":{"starsCount":1,"forksCount":0,"subscribersCount":1,"issues":{"count":1,"openCount":0,"distribution":{"3600":1,"10800":0,"32400":0,"97200":0,"291600":0,"874800":0,"2624400":0,"7873200":0,"23619600":0,"70858800":0,"212576400":0},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"billyvg","commitsCount":11}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","count":6},{"from":"2021-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","count":11},{"from":"2021-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","count":11},{"from":"2021-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","count":11},{"from":"2020-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","count":11}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":1486,"testsSize":0},"linters":["prettier"]}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.84,"tests":0,"health":1,"branding":0},"popularity":{"communityInterest":3,"downloadsCount":12,"downloadsAcceleration":0.30068493150684933,"dependentsCount":0},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":1,"commitsFrequency":0.9,"openIssues":1,"issuesDistribution":1}},"score":{"final":0.5157995884106603,"detail":{"quality":0.5296848417571351,"popularity":0.019710475028699673,"maintenance":0.9999870560670712}}}
