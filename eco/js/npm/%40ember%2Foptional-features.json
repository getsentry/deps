To clarify what we mean by optional, these are features that will be opt-in/opt-out and optional for the foreseeable future, not features that will be enabled by default. It is intended for use with apps *only* not addons.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nember install @ember/optional-features\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### From command-line\n\n#### List available features\n\nFeatures will only be available in versions of ember-source that included them. To list all available features run:\n\n```bash\nember feature:list\n```\n\n#### Enable/disable features\n\nTo enable a feature, run:\n\n```bash\nember feature:enable some-feature\n```\n\nSimilarly, if you want to disable a feature, you can run:\n\n```bash\nember feature:disable some-feature\n```\n\n### At build-time (from an addon)\n\nThis addon exposes a build-time method called `isFeatureEnabled`, which can be called from an addon's `index.js`, e.g.:\n\n```javascript\nincluded() {\n  let optionalFeatues = this.addons.find(a => a.name === '@ember/optional-features');\n  if (optionalFeatures.isFeatureEnabled('jquery-integration') {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt also exposes a method called `isFeatureExplicitlySet`, which can be used to check whether or not the user has explictly set the value of the option instead of using the default.\n\n### At run-time (from an app or addon)\n\nWIP -- there does not yet exist a public API for accessing the state of optional features at runtime. [This](https://github.com/pzuraq/ember-compatibility-helpers/issues/27) issue is tracking it."},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":117208},{"from":"2021-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":486520},{"from":"2021-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":1511286},{"from":"2021-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":3138230},{"from":"2020-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":5620832}],"dependentsCount":9,"starsCount":0},"github":{"starsCount":39,"forksCount":10,"subscribersCount":13,"issues":{"count":316,"openCount":15,"distribution":{"3600":121,"10800":19,"32400":14,"97200":19,"291600":22,"874800":20,"2624400":41,"7873200":36,"23619600":17,"70858800":4,"212576400":3},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"rwjblue","commitsCount":32},{"username":"dependabot-preview[bot]","commitsCount":3},{"username":"cibernox","commitsCount":2},{"username":"alkamin","commitsCount":2},{"username":"simonihmig","commitsCount":3},{"username":"chancancode","commitsCount":15},{"username":"locks","commitsCount":1},{"username":"rwwagner90","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mike-north","commitsCount":2},{"username":"pizza","commitsCount":1},{"username":"bendemboski","commitsCount":1},{"username":"Turbo87","commitsCount":9},{"username":"ember-tomster","commitsCount":1}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":8},{"from":"2021-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":18},{"from":"2020-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","count":58}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":1599,"testsSize":27621,"hasNpmIgnore":true,"hasChangelog":true},"linters":["editorconfig","eslint","prettier"],"outdatedDependencies":{"inquirer":{"required":"^7.3.3","stable":"8.1.2","latest":"8.1.2"}}}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.9999999999999999,"tests":0.6,"health":0.75,"branding":0},"popularity":{"communityInterest":75,"downloadsCount":503762,"downloadsAcceleration":713.2162480974125,"dependentsCount":9},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":0.39760273972602744,"commitsFrequency":0.7651712328767123,"openIssues":1,"issuesDistribution":0.7880765979471478}},"score":{"final":0.6645147923697611,"detail":{"quality":0.8359814206057153,"popularity":0.2153878618126199,"maintenance":0.9666703272960844}}}
