Compiling only what's needed can make your bundles smaller and your life easier.\n\nThis example only includes the polyfills and code transforms needed for coverage of users > 0.25%, ignoring Internet Explorer 11 and Opera Mini.. We use [browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) to parse this information, so you can use [any valid query format supported by browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist#queries).\n\n```js\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    [\"env\", {\n      \"targets\": {\n        // The % refers to the global coverage of users from browserslist\n        \"browsers\": [ \">0.25%\", \"not ie 11\", \"not op_mini all\"]\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> You can also target individual versions of browsers instead of using a query with `\"targets\": { \"chrome\": \"52\" }`.\n\nSimilarly, if you're targeting Node.js instead of the browser, you can configure babel-preset-env to only include the polyfills and transforms necessary for a particular version:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    [\"env\", {\n      \"targets\": {\n        \"node\": \"6.10\"\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFor convenience, you can use `\"node\": \"current\"` to only include the necessary polyfills and transforms for the Node.js version that you use to run Babel:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    [\"env\", {\n      \"targets\": {\n        \"node\": \"current\"\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nCheck out the many options (especially `useBuiltIns` to polyfill less)!\n\n- [How it Works](#how-it-works)\n- [Install](#install)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Options](#options)\n- [Examples](#examples)\n- [Caveats](#caveats)\n- [Other Cool Projects](#other-cool-projects)\n\n## How it Works\n\n### Determine environment support for ECMAScript features\n\nUse external data such as [`compat-table`](https://github.com/kangax/compat-table) to determine browser support. (We should create PRs there when necessary)\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/588473/19214029/58deebce-8d48-11e6-9004-ee3fbcb75d8b.png)\n\nWe can periodically run [build-data.js](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/scripts/build-data.js) which generates [plugins.json](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/data/plugins.json).\n\nRef: [#7](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/issues/7)\n\n### Maintain a mapping between JavaScript features and Babel plugins\n\n> Currently located at [plugin-features.js](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/data/plugin-features.js).\n\nThis should be straightforward to do in most cases. There might be cases where plugins should be split up more or certain plugins aren't standalone enough (or impossible to do).\n\n### Support all plugins in Babel that are considered `latest`\n\n> Default behavior without options is the same as `babel-preset-latest`.\n\nIt won't include `stage-x` plugins. env will support all plugins in what we consider the latest version of JavaScript (by matching what we do in [`babel-preset-latest`](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-latest/)).\n\nRef: [#14](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/issues/14)\n\n### Determine the lowest common denominator of plugins to be included in the preset\n\nIf you are targeting IE 8 and Chrome 55 it will include all plugins required by IE 8 since you would need to support both still.\n\n### Support a target option `\"node\": \"current\"` to compile for the currently running node version.\n\nFor example, if you are building on Node 6, arrow functions won't be converted, but they will if you build on Node 0.12.\n\n### Support a `browsers` option like autoprefixer\n\nUse [browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) to declare supported environments by performing queries like `> 1%, last 2 versions`.\n\nRef: [#19](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/pull/19)\n\n## Install\n\nWith [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev babel-preset-env\n```\n\nOr [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):\n\n```sh\nyarn add babel-preset-env --dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe default behavior without options runs all transforms (behaves the same as [babel-preset-latest](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-latest/)).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"env\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Options\n\nFor more information on setting options for a preset, refer to the [plugin/preset options](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#plugin-preset-options) documentation.\n\n### `targets`\n\n`{ [string]: number | string }`, defaults to `{}`.\n\nTakes an object of environment versions to support.\n\nEach target environment takes a number or a string (we recommend using a string when specifying minor versions like `node: \"6.10\"`).\n\nExample environments: `chrome`, `opera`, `edge`, `firefox`, `safari`, `ie`, `ios`, `android`, `node`, `electron`.\n\nThe [data](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/data/plugins.json) for this is generated by running the [build-data script](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/scripts/build-data.js) which pulls in data from [compat-table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table).\n\n### `targets.node`\n\n`number | string | \"current\" | true`\n\nIf you want to compile against the current node version, you can specify `\"node\": true` or `\"node\": \"current\"`, which would be the same as `\"node\": process.versions.node`.\n\n### `targets.browsers`\n\n`Array<string> | string`\n\nA query to select browsers (ex: last 2 versions, > 5%) using [browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist).\n\nNote, browsers' results are overridden by explicit items from `targets`.\n\n### `targets.uglify`\n\n`true`\n\nWhen using `uglify-js` to minify your code, you may run into syntax errors when targeting later browsers since `uglify-js` does not support any ES2015+ syntax.\n\nTo prevent these errors - set the `uglify` option to `true`, which enables all transformation plugins and as a result, your code is fully compiled to ES5. However, the `useBuiltIns` option will still work as before and only include the polyfills that your target(s) need.\n\n> Uglify has support for ES2015 syntax via [uglify-es](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/tree/harmony). If you are using syntax unsupported by `uglify-es`, we recommend using [babel-minify](https://github.com/babel/minify).\n\n> Note: This option is deprecated in 2.x and replaced with a [`forceAllTransforms` option](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/pull/264).\n\n### `spec`\n\n`boolean`, defaults to `false`.\n\nEnable more spec compliant, but potentially slower, transformations for any plugins in this preset that support them.\n\n### `loose`\n\n`boolean`, defaults to `false`.\n\nEnable \"loose\" transformations for any plugins in this preset that allow them.\n\n### `modules`\n\n`\"amd\" | \"umd\" | \"systemjs\" | \"commonjs\" | false`, defaults to `\"commonjs\"`.\n\nEnable transformation of ES6 module syntax to another module type.\n\nSetting this to `false` will not transform modules.\n\n### `debug`\n\n`boolean`, defaults to `false`.\n\nOutputs the targets/plugins used and the version specified in [plugin data version](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/data/plugins.json) to `console.log`.\n\n### `include`\n\n`Array<string>`, defaults to `[]`.\n\n> NOTE: `whitelist` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major in favor of this.\n\nAn array of plugins to always include.\n\nValid options include any:\n\n- [Babel plugins](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/data/plugin-features.js) - both with (`babel-plugin-transform-es2015-spread`) and without prefix (`transform-es2015-spread`) are supported.\n\n- [Built-ins](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/data/built-in-features.js), such as `map`, `set`, or `object.assign`.\n\nThis option is useful if there is a bug in a native implementation, or a combination of a non-supported feature + a supported one doesn't work.\n\nFor example, Node 4 supports native classes but not spread. If `super` is used with a spread argument, then the `transform-es2015-classes` transform needs to be `include`d, as it is not possible to transpile a spread with `super` otherwise.\n\n> NOTE: The `include` and `exclude` options _only_ work with the [plugins included with this preset](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/data/plugin-features.js); so, for example, including `transform-do-expressions` or excluding `transform-function-bind` will throw errors. To use a plugin _not_ included with this preset, add them to your [config](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/) directly.\n\n### `exclude`\n\n`Array<string>`, defaults to `[]`.\n\nAn array of plugins to always exclude/remove.\n\nThe possible options are the same as the `include` option.\n\nThis option is useful for \"blacklisting\" a transform like `transform-regenerator` if you don't use generators and don't want to include `regeneratorRuntime` (when using `useBuiltIns`) or for using another plugin like [fast-async](https://github.com/MatAtBread/fast-async) instead of [Babel's async-to-gen](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-async-generator-functions/).\n\n### `useBuiltIns`\n\n`boolean`, defaults to `false`.\n\nA way to apply `babel-preset-env` for polyfills (via \"babel-polyfill\").\n\n> NOTE: This does not currently polyfill experimental/stage-x built-ins like the regular \"babel-polyfill\" does.\n> This will only work with npm >= 3 (which should be used with Babel 6 anyway)\n\n```\nnpm install babel-polyfill --save\n```\n\nThis option enables a new plugin that replaces the statement `import \"babel-polyfill\"` or `require(\"babel-polyfill\")` with individual requires for `babel-polyfill` based on environment.\n\n> NOTE: Only use `require(\"babel-polyfill\");` once in your whole app.\n> Multiple imports or requires of `babel-polyfill` will throw an error since it can cause global collisions and other issues that are hard to trace.\n> We recommend creating a single entry file that only contains the `require` statement.\n\n**In**\n\n```js\nimport \"babel-polyfill\";\n```\n\n**Out (different based on environment)**\n\n```js\nimport \"core-js/modules/es7.string.pad-start\";\nimport \"core-js/modules/es7.string.pad-end\";\nimport \"core-js/modules/web.timers\";\nimport \"core-js/modules/web.immediate\";\nimport \"core-js/modules/web.dom.iterable\";\n```\n\nThis will also work for `core-js` directly (`import \"core-js\";`)\n\n```\nnpm install core-js --save\n```\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### Export with various targets\n\n```js\nexport class A {}\n```\n\n#### Target only Chrome

]\n}\n```\n\n## Caveats\n\nIf you get a `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ...` error when using the
