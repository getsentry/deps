See the [type definitions][type-definitions] for more information on the events and state data currently available.\n\n```js\nimport {Event, State} from 'jest-circus';\nimport NodeEnvironment from 'jest-environment-node';\n\nclass MyCustomEnvironment extends NodeEnvironment {\n  //...\n\n  async handleTestEvent(event: Event, state: State) {\n    if (event.name === 'test_start') {\n      // ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMutating event or state data is currently unsupported and may cause unexpected behavior or break in a future release without warning. New events, event data, and/or state data will not be considered a breaking change and may be added in any minor release.\n\nNote, that `jest-circus` test runner would pause until a promise returned from `handleTestEvent` gets fulfilled. **However, there are a few events that do not conform to this rule, namely**: `start_describe_definition`, `finish_describe_definition`, `add_hook`, `add_test` or `error` (for the up-to-date list you can look at [SyncEvent type in the types definitions][type-definitions]). That is caused by backward compatibility reasons and `process.on('unhandledRejection', callback)` signature, but that usually should not be a problem for most of the use cases.\n\n## Installation\n\n> Note: As of Jest 27, `jest-circus` is the default test runner, so you do not have to install it to use it.\n\nInstall `jest-circus` using yarn:\n\n```bash\nyarn add --dev jest-circus\n```\n\nOr via npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev jest-circus\n```\n\n## Configure\n\nConfigure Jest to use `jest-circus` via the [`testRunner`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#testrunner-string) option:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"testRunner\": \"jest-circus/runner\"\n}\n```\n\nOr via CLI:\n\n```bash\njest --testRunner='jest-circus/runner'\n```"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","count":795311},{"from":"2021-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","count":4192925},{"from":"2021-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","count":17206493},{"from":"2021-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","count":43144819},{"from":"2021-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","count":64333766},{"from":"2020-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","count":82022377}],"dependentsCount":404,"starsCount":0},"github":{"homepage":"https://jestjs.io","starsCount":36204,"forksCount":5280,"subscribersCount":550,"issues":{"count":11742,"openCount":1603,"distribution":{"3600":2347,"10800":1049,"32400":1021,"97200":1463,"291600":1045,"874800":898,"2624400":791,"7873200":809,"23619600":758,"70858800":1030,"212576400":531},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"mjesun","commitsCount":106},{"username":"wincent","commitsCount":7},{"username":"thymikee","commitsCount":174},{"username":"DmitrySoshnikov","commitsCount":33},{"username":"wtgtybhertgeghgtwtg","commitsCount":44},{"username":"WeiAnAn","commitsCount":8},{"username":"keyz","commitsCount":7},{"username":"ychi","commitsCount":5},{"username":"arcanis","commitsCount":16},{"username":"jeanlauliac","commitsCount":19},{"username":"orta","commitsCount":36},{"username":"eps1lon","commitsCount":7},{"username":"mbelsky","commitsCount":5},{"username":"trivikr","commitsCount":5},{"username":"valerybugakov","commitsCount":6},{"username":"snitin315","commitsCount":12},{"username":"Haroenv","commitsCount":6},{"username":"emmenko","commitsCount":8},{"username":"seanpoulter","commitsCount":12},{"username":"flozender","commitsCount":6},{"username":"captbaritone","commitsCount":14},{"username":"SimenB","commitsCount":953},{"username":"kentcdodds","commitsCount":7},{"username":"sophiebits","commitsCount":13},{"username":"H1Gdev","commitsCount":10},{"username":"natealcedo","commitsCount":15},{"username":"cpojer","commitsCount":660},{"username":"xfumihiro","commitsCount":13},{"username":"Daniel15","commitsCount":14},{"username":"aaronabramov","commitsCount":213},{"username":"abdulhannanali","commitsCount":6},{"username":"ranyitz","commitsCount":21},{"username":"leebyron","commitsCount":19},{"username":"jeffmo","commitsCount":19},{"username":"anilreddykatta","commitsCount":8},{"username":"kl3ryk","commitsCount":6},{"username":"UselessPickles","commitsCount":5},{"username":"zpao","commitsCount":17},{"username":"jquense","commitsCount":6},{"username":"Mark1626","commitsCount":10},{"username":"hankhsiao","commitsCount":11},{"username":"blainekasten","commitsCount":6},{"username":"genintho","commitsCount":5},{"username":"wyze","commitsCount":8},{"username":"maximderbin","commitsCount":9},{"username":"grosto","commitsCount":5},{"username":"scotthovestadt","commitsCount":33},{"username":"azz","commitsCount":8},{"username":"dubzzz","commitsCount":12},{"username":"amasad","commitsCount":22},{"username":"clentfort","commitsCount":10},{"username":"rafeca","commitsCount":7},{"username":"PhilVargas","commitsCount":18},{"username":"jeysal","commitsCount":63},{"username":"cpenarrieta","commitsCount":6},{"username":"hramos","commitsCount":32},{"username":"mattphillips","commitsCount":40},{"username":"kentaromiura","commitsCount":38},{"username":"harshadsabne","commitsCount":6},{"username":"hron","commitsCount":5},{"username":"jamesgeorge007","commitsCount":8},{"username":"vjeux","commitsCount":18},{"username":"excitement-engineer","commitsCount":8},{"username":"jbonta","commitsCount":5},{"username":"yungsters","commitsCount":9},{"username":"ide","commitsCount":10},{"username":"gaearon","commitsCount":23},{"username":"jakeboone02","commitsCount":5},{"username":"Connormiha","commitsCount":40},{"username":"wsmd","commitsCount":5},{"username":"ghostd","commitsCount":8},{"username":"lencioni","commitsCount":6},{"username":"rickhanlonii","commitsCount":53},{"username":"palmerj3","commitsCount":11},{"username":"ericnakagawa","commitsCount":30},{"username":"skovhus","commitsCount":6},{"username":"wojtekmaj","commitsCount":6},{"username":"robinpokorny","commitsCount":6},{"username":"rubennorte","commitsCount":55},{"username":"endiliey","commitsCount":10},{"username":"danez","commitsCount":8},{"username":"dandv","commitsCount":5},{"username":"Andarist","commitsCount":5},{"username":"TheSavior","commitsCount":5},{"username":"stephnr","commitsCount":8},{"username":"ahnpnl","commitsCount":21},{"username":"niieani","commitsCount":6},{"username":"jwbay","commitsCount":7},{"username":"rogeliog","commitsCount":56},{"username":"andreipfeiffer","commitsCount":5},{"username":"G-Rath","commitsCount":22},{"username":"JoshRosenstein","commitsCount":6},{"username":"pedrottimark","commitsCount":161},{"username":"bookman25","commitsCount":10},{"username":"doniyor2109","commitsCount":8},{"username":"BYK","commitsCount":9},{"
