Returns `true` if no additional keystrokes were required from user (so, `execCommand`, IE's `clipboardData` worked) or `false`.\n\n|Value |Default |Notes|\n|------|--------|-----|\n|options.debug  |false| `Boolean`. Optional. Enable output to console. |\n|options.message|Copy to clipboard: `#{key}`, Enter| `String`. Optional. Prompt message. `*` |\n|options.format|\"text/html\"| `String`. Optional. Set the MIME type of what you want to copy as. Use `text/html` to copy as HTML, `text/plain` to avoid inherited styles showing when pasted into rich text editor. |\n|options.onCopy|null| `function onCopy(clipboardData: object): void`. Optional. Receives the clipboardData element for adding custom behavior such as additional formats |\n\n`*` all occurrences of `#{key}` are replaced with `⌘+C` for macOS/iOS users, and `Ctrl+C` otherwise.\n\n# [Browser support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=document-execcommand)\n\nWorks everywhere where `prompt`* is available. Works best (i.e. without additional keystrokes) in Chrome, FF, Safari 10+, and, supposedly, IE/Edge.\n\nNote: **does not work on some older iOS devices.**  \n`*` – even though **Safari 8** has `prompt`, you cannot specify prefilled content for prompt modal – thus it **doesn't work** as expected.\n\n# Installation\n\n+ Can be used as npm package and then leveraged using commonjs bundler/loader:\n```\nnpm i --save copy-to-clipboard\n```\n+ Can be utilized using [wzrd.in](https://wzrd.in/). Add following script to your page:\n```html\n<script src=\"https://wzrd.in/standalone/copy-to-clipboard@latest\" async></script>\n```\nYou will have `window.copyToClipboard` exposed for you to use.\n\n# UI components based on this package:\n+ [react-copy-to-clipboard](https://github.com/nkbt/react-copy-to-clipboard)\n+ [copy-button](https://github.com/sudodoki/copy-button)\n\n# See also:\n+ [clipboard-copy](https://github.com/feross/clipboard-copy) by [@feross](https://github.com/feross)\n+ [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand#Browser_Compatibility)\n+ [April 2015 update on Cut and Copy Commands](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2015/04/cut-and-copy-commands)\n\n# Running Tests\nThis project has some automated tests, that will run using [nightwatch](nightwatchjs.org) on top of [selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/).\n\n```\nnpm i\nnpm test\n```\n# Typescript\nThis library has built-in Typescript definitions.\n\n```\nimport * as copy from 'copy-to-clipboard';\n```"},"npm":{"downloads":[{"from":"2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","count":3356545},{"from":"2021-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","count":14517393},{"from":"2021-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","count":45294843},{"from":"2021-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","count":87728907},{"from":"2020-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","count":155773861}],"dependentsCount":652,"starsCount":15},"github":{"homepage":"http://sudodoki.github.io/copy-to-clipboard/example/","starsCount":835,"forksCount":98,"subscribersCount":9,"issues":{"count":113,"openCount":31,"distribution":{"3600":10,"10800":7,"32400":1,"97200":10,"291600":8,"874800":9,"2624400":13,"7873200":10,"23619600":17,"70858800":13,"212576400":15},"isDisabled":false},"contributors":[{"username":"DenisCarriere","commitsCount":2},{"username":"sudodoki","commitsCount":75},{"username":"nkbt","commitsCount":1},{"username":"mariusandra","commitsCount":1},{"username":"wdlb","commitsCount":1},{"username":"phiggins","commitsCount":1},{"username":"pugnascotia","commitsCount":1},{"username":"evenchange4","commitsCount":1},{"username":"ljharb","commitsCount":1},{"username":"MartynasZilinskas","commitsCount":1},{"username":"sloanesturz","commitsCount":1},{"username":"shvaikalesh","commitsCount":10},{"username":"zombieJ","commitsCount":1},{"username":"julienw","commitsCount":1}],"commits":[{"from":"2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2021-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","count":0},{"from":"2020-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","to":"2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","count":0}],"statuses":[{"context":"continuous-integration/travis-ci/push","state":"failure"},{"context":"github/pages","state":"success"}]},"source":{"files":{"readmeSize":3116,"testsSize":1720,"hasNpmIgnore":true},"badges":[{"urls":{"original":"https://travis-ci.org/sudodoki/copy-to-clipboard.svg?branch=master","service":"https://api.travis-ci.org/sudodoki/copy-to-clipboard.svg?branch=master","shields":"https://img.shields.io/travis/sudodoki/copy-to-clipboard/master.svg","content":"https://img.shields.io/travis/sudodoki/copy-to-clipboard/master.json"},"info":{"service":"travis","type":"build","modifiers":{"branch":"master"}}}]}},"evaluation":{"quality":{"carefulness":0.7899999999999999,"tests":0.725,"health":1,"branding":0.15},"popularity":{"communityInterest":971,"downloadsCount":15098281,"downloadsAcceleration":29435.128481735155,"dependentsCount":652},"maintenance":{"releasesFrequency":0.04931506849315069,"commitsFrequency":0,"openIssues":0.8761061946902655,"issuesDistribution":0}},"score":{"final":0.548827501753077,"detail":{"quality":0.921433010095226,"popularity":0.56088434155084,"maintenance":0.21739451194775788}}}
